Then, according to the Government of C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), Bank of China and the Government of C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire signed two loan agreements on May 22, 2019 for Phase 1 of the Abidjan PK24 Industrial Zone Project: a CFA 52,795,025,919 loan agreement (captured via Project ID#52214) and a CFA 7,919,254,068.52 loan agreement (captured via Project ID#92228). The borrowing terms of the two loans are unknown. However, it is known that the CFA 52,795,025,919 loan was backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the CFA 52,795,025,919 loan to finance 87% of the cost of a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd. (CHEC) and the Government of C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire, which was signed in September 2015. It was expected to use the proceeds of the CFA 7,919,254,068.52 loan to finance 13% of the cost of the same commercial contract.   The CFA 52,795,025,919 had achieved a 96% disbursement rate as of July 31, 2022. 3 disbursements (worth CFA 46,269,632,117.23) were made through the CFA 52,795,025,919 loan agreement: a CFA 11,266,380,848 disbursement on December 31, 2020, a CFA 28,851,997,584.23 disbursement on December 31, 2021, and a CFA 6,151,253,685 disbursement on July 31, 2022.  The CFA 7,919,253,740.55 loan full disbursed (in a single tranche) on December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to develop 127 hectares within the Akoup\\u00e9-Zeudji industrial zone (park) \\u2014 located in a northwestern suburb of Abidjan (Cocody Danga, Rue des Jasmins) \\u2014 and provide the new area with modern and quality infrastructure (including drinking water supply, electricity, and wastewater treatment). Construction works include roads, drainage, drinking water supply, wastewater treatment, and electricity. The industrial zone consists of 940 hectares in total and it is being built in multiple phases.   CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of Phase 1. The Ivorian Minister of Trade, Industry and Promotion Souleymane DIARRASSOUBA, China Communication Construction Company Deputy Managing Director Mr. Li Yi, and China Road and Bridge Corporation Vice President Mr. Wen Gang signed an implementation agreement with CHEC on December 14, 2018. Then, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 1, 2019. However, construction did not begin until December 1, 2019. Construction was originally scheduled to last 18 months, but the COVID-19 pandemic led to implementation delays. This project had achieved a 49.36% completion rate as of 2021. By April 2022, all site installation activities were complete, 98% of right-of-way clearance activities were complete, and 50% of earthworks were complete. The project\\u2019s electricity component had achieved a 10% completion rate; its drinking water supply component had achieved a 10% completion rate; and its wastewater treatment component had achieved a 6% completion rate.   The project\\u2019s originally scheduled completion date was December 31, 2021. However, the project is running behind schedule because of land disputes (with approximately 500 local residents refusing to vacate the project site and accept CFA 300,000 of compensation per household) and problems related to the COVID-19 pandemic (high rates of absenteeism; team productivity reductions; Chinese employees being stranded in China due to the closure of the Ivorian borders; limited supplies of equipment and materials; fewer meetings; and less effective communication).\",\"In 2017, China Eximbank and China Development Bank together provided $105,510,000 in debt financing for the Shargun Coal Mine Modernization Project. China Eximbank provided a $89.5 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) loan and China Development Bank provided a $16,010,000 loan (captured via Project ID#40326). Project ID#72686 captures the China Eximbank PBC loan, which was finalized on May 12, 2017 and carries the following terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Uzbekistan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan.  The Shargun Coal Mine Modernization Project \\u2014 also known as the \\u201cModernization of JSC \\u201cShargunkumir\\u201d Project or \\u4e86\\u6c99\\u5c14\\u8d21\\u7164\\u77ff\\u73b0\\u4ee3\\u5316 \\u2014 seeks to replace the existing technologies and production at Baisun and Shargun coal deposits and bring project capacity to 900 thousand tons of coal per year. It also involves the modernization of the system of coal transportation. China Coal Technology & Engineering Group (CCTEG) is the contractor responsible for project implementation and its work is being overseen by  Uzbekcoal JSC. Through its contract with Uzbekcoal JSC, CCTEG is responsible for delivering two mechanized complexes with production capacity of 450,000 tons per year each on a turnkey basis. China Railway Tunnel Group Co., Ltd. is also involved in project implementation.  As of September 12, 2017, China Coal Technology & Engineering Group Corp., and China Railway Tunnel Group Co., Ltd., began the preparatory work for this project. Project implementation officially began on May 23, 2018.  The project was expected to reached completion in 2020. The project implementation had been delayed due to the rise of COVID-19 and flight suspension of various construction workers. The planned project duration was projected to be 38 months.The renovation project is a consortium formed by the China Railway Tunnel and the China Coal and Science Industry. Du Yaobo, general manager of Nanjing Design Institute delivered a speech before the launching ceremony. From August 10-11, the three machine ground joint commissioning of the project's working face was conducted. \",\"On April 10, 2012, Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) \\u2014 a state-owned company in Costa Rica \\u2014 signed an $89 million supplier's credit (loan) agreement with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, in turn, secured a receivables financing facility from Bank of China. The loan to ICE carried the following borrowing terms: a fixed interest rate of 5.45% and a maturity length of 5.5 years. The final maturity date of the loan was April 10, 2017 (later amended to January 30, 2018), and the borrower was responsible for making semi-annual loan repayments. The loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower to acquire telecommunications equipment and services from Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and thereby support the expansion of a 3G advanced mobile system in Costa Rica. The loan was reportedly insured by Sinosure. As of September 2014, this facility had not been drawn upon, and September 2014 was the most recent mention of it in ICE reports.  The 3G network expansion project was plagued by controversy. In 2009, ICE awarded a $235 million contract to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. to deploy a 3G network over a five year period, but Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. reportedly breached the contract from 2011-14. ICE then opened a summary procedure to collect a $6.7 million fine for the contractual breaches, which Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. accepted (as evidenced by official communication 5225-1031-2016 from November 22, 2016). However, instead of paying the fine, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. offered to settle the matter by making donations ($5.2 million of fixed internet equipment and $1.5 million of support services) equal to the amount of the fine.  In 2017, ICE\\u2019s former telecom director, Jaime Palermo, accepted the offer in November 2017 (as evidenced by official letter 6000-1513-2017 from November 9, 2017). Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. then offered Palermo an $8.3 million project to expand fixed internet coverage in the country\\u2019s metropolitan areas. ICE would only have to pay $1.6 million as the remainder that was not already covered by the $6.7 million donation. Palermo approved a contract for the project that same year, making Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. ICE\\u2019s biggest fixed-internet infrastructure provider and side-stepping an open competition in which other proposals could have been considered. In December 2019, La Naci\\u00f3n reported that the public prosecutor's office in Costa Rica launched an investigation, which in turn led to an in-house audit report by ICE. The $60 million supplier credit is captured via Project ID#54892. The $6.7 million donation is captured via Project ID#86881.\",\"In June 2013, China Development Bank issued a $93,000,000 loan to XCMG Brasil Investimentos Ltda, the Brazilian branch of the Chinese construction equipment supplying company XCMG Construction.

The loan was secured by (collateralized with) a power plant owned by the borrower (PT Indah Kiat Pulp & Paper Tbk).  PT Purinusa Ekapersad \\u2014 the parent company of PT Indah Kiat Pulp & Paper Tbk and a part of Sinar Mas Group \\u2014 also issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. The loan carried a 7 year maturity, but its interest rate is unknown.  As of December 31, 2012, the outstanding balance of the loan from CDB amounted to $73.4 million. As of March 31, 2013, the outstanding balance of the loan was $72.8 million. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding balance of the loan was $14.7 million.\",\"On December 12, 2006, China Eximbank and the Government of Yemen\\u2019s Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation signed an RMB 240,000,000 ($31,168,830) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Bajil Cement Factory Expansion and Modernization Project (captured via Project ID#41175). Then, on February 12, 2008, the Yemeni Cabinet approved the GCL. The borrowing terms of the GCL are unknown.   In addition, China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and the Government of Yemen signed a $59,231,170 supplier credit (vendor financing) agreement on February 2, 2007 (captured via Project ID#41176). This agreement was referred by the Yemeni Cabinet to the Parliament on February 12, 2008. It was then approved into law on April 27, 2008 (Law No. 23). The borrowing terms of the supplier\\u2019s credit, which CMEC provided with support from an export seller\\u2019s credit from China Eximbank, are also unknown.   The proceeds of the loan and the supplier credit ($90.4 million in total) were to be used by the borrower to finance 80% of the $113 million cost of a commercial contract with CMEC.   The purpose of the project was the expand and modernize a cement factory in Bajil (\\u0628\\u0627\\u062c\\u0644;) District (also known as Bajal or Bajel District and incorrectly transliterated from Chinese as Bagir or Baghir District) within Al Hudaydah Governorate. The ultimate objective of the project was to increase the annual cement production capacity of the plant from 250,000 tons to 850,000 tons per year and to construct a coal-fired power station at the cement plant.   A commercial contract with CMEC was signed in December 2007, and project implementation commenced shortly thereafter. Then, on January 18, 2009, a supplementary contract with CMEC was signed for the construction of a 32MW coal-fired power station at the cement plant. However, implementation halted in early 2011 due to conflict and instability in Yemen (when the project had already achieved a 55% completion rate). Then, an agreement was signed in September 2012 to resume construction. In February 2014, representatives from CMEC, the Bajil Cement Factory, the Yemeni Ministry of Industry, and the Chinese Economic and Commercial Counselor\\u2019s Office met to discuss obstacles to project implementation. According to CMEC's website, the originally planned completion date was December 2014. However, it does not appear that this project ever reached completion. All CMEC employees involved in the implementation of this project were evacuated on March 30, 2015 after a series of Saudi-led airstrikes against Houthi rebels. \",\"On December 21, 2007, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with regard to utilizing a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to execute the Port of St John\\u2019s Renovation and Extension Project. On November 18, 2013, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) signed an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with regard to utilizing a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to execute the Port of St John\\u2019s Renovation and Extension Project. Then, on November 11, 2014, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda submitted a project proposal and application for a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to the Embassy of the People\\u2019s Republic of China in Antigua. On December 22, 2014, Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority and CCECC signed an RMB 1,590,000,000 commercial (\\u2018design and construction\\u2019) contract (#AB/PMP-01) for the Port of St John\\u2019s Renovation and Extension Project. Then, on May 25, 2015, Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority and CCECC signed a revised commercial contract (#AB/PMP-02) worth RMB 585,000,000. Then, on November 25, 2016, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed an RMB 600 million government concessional loan (GCL) for the Port of St John\\u2019s Renovation and Extension Project. Less than a month later, on December 15, 2016, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed a framework agreement for a RMB 600 million government concessional loan (GCL) for the Port of St John\\u2019s Renovation and Extension Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 21.75 years. The final maturity date of the GCL is March 19, 2038. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance the RMB 585,000,000 commercial contract that was signed on May 25, 2015. The remaining RMB 15,000,000 was to be used by the borrower to finance a contract with Guangxi Bagui Project Supervision and Consultant Co. Ltd for project management and supervision activities related to the Port of St John\\u2019s Renovation and Extension Project. The borrower also agreed to deposit the operating income generated by the project in an escrow account to support debt service requirements.   The purpose of the project is to bring about the long-awaited transformation of the St. John\\u2019s Port from a break-bulk facility to a modern container port facility that is capable of increasing annual cargo throughput from 16,000 containers to 80,000 containers. It involves the construction of a new Customs and Port Authority headquarters, the expansion of a quay (extension of the existing pier), the construction of a new warehouse for processing goods, the extension of a sea wall, the dredging of the harbor, and the establishment of a logistics park. Some of the expected project benefits include improved ship-to-shore interface; greater efficiency in the clearance of goods; automated scanning and computerized handling/clearance of goods; reduced ground transportation costs, and greater ease of doing business.   CCECC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on January 15, 2018. However, the project did not commence until September 8, 2018. It was originally envisaged that the project would take three years to implement.  Satellite imagery suggests that, as of July 2020, a 320-meter quay expansion and the construction of a new warehouse were complete (or nearly completed).

The GCL carried the following terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, and a 1.25% interest rate. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance an EPC (commercial) contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).  The purpose of the project is to construct a  96.48 km segment of National Road No. 11 (NR 11) that runs from Nak Leoung to Thnal Torteung.  NR 11 connects National Road 1 (NR 1) in Prey Veng Province to National Road 7 (NR 7) in Tbong Khmum province.  CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. The project entered implementation on March 23, 2018, and it was originally expected to reach completion on September 16, 2020. Cambodia\\u2019s Minister of Public Works and Transport Sun Chanthol conducted an-site project inspection on May 4, 2020. On December 6, 2021, the Cambodia National Highway was officially opened to traffic. \",\"On April 5, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Myanmar signed a $101.98 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Upper Yeywa-Shwesaryan 230 kV Transmission Line and 230 kV Shwesaryan Substation Extension Project. The signing of the loan agreement marked the completion of the financing of the project and a major breakthrough in the progress of the project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 90% of the cost of a commercial contract with Hydrochina Corporation (\\u4e2d\\u56fd\\u6c34\\u7535\\u5de5\\u7a0b\\u987e\\u95ee\\u96c6\\u56e2), which was signed on March 1, 2012.

The purpose of the project was to construct a 129 km, 230 kV power transmission line from a to-be-constructed 280MW (4x70MW) Upper Yeywa Hydropower Plant (exact locational coordinates: 22.2413452801704, 97.10127992329045) to the Shwesaryan (Shwe Sar Yan) substation (exact locational coordinates: 21.85798, 96.23105) in Patheingyi Township. As of 2017, this project had achieved a 28% completion rate. However, AidData has not identified any evidence that it reached completion.   Implementation delays are likely related to the fact that the 280MW (4x70MW) Upper Yeywa Hydropower Plant was still not complete as of Q2 of 2021 and its construction has triggered various protests. Shan civil society groups have opposed the building of the Upper Yeywa Hydropower Plant. They claim that the project, which was started by the military regime in 2008, was initiated without local consultation or consent and that the reservoir of the 280 megawatt dam will stretch for 60 kilometers up to Hsipaw town, submerging centuries-old Shan communities and fertile farmlands. The dam site also lies in an active conflict zone, and Burma Army troops guarding the site have allegedly committed gross human rights violations against local villagers, including extrajudicial killing, torture and use of human shields. On February 17, 2021, workers from the Upper Yeywa dam site joined protests in Kyaukme, holding a banner that said \\u2018Upper Yeywa Hydropower Project Civil Disobedience Movement.\\u2019   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Upper Yeywa-Shwesaryan 230 kV Transmission Line and 230 kV Shwesaryan Substation Extension Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 3 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreements, 6 government concessional loan (GCL) agreements, and 27 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreements (as captured via Project ID#98029).  Debt service payments under many of these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#96221).\",\"On June 3, 2013, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Costa Rica signed two financing agreements worth $396 million for the Rehabilitation and Extension of National Route N\\u00b0 32 Cross Section Route 4-Lim\\u00f3n. The Costa Rican Government approved these financing agreements on March 10, 2015 through Law N\\u00b0 9293.  The first agreement is a USD-denominated buyer's credit loan (ID# 1420202052013211015) worth $296 million (captured via Project ID#37364). The buyer's credit loan (BCL) carries the following borrowing terms: a 4% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a maturity of 20 years, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.  The second financing agreement is a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2013) 30 TOTAL NO.

The GCL carries the following terms: an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a maturity of 20 years, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and BCL to finance 85% of the cost of a $465,593,387.06 commercial (EPC) contract [CONAVI-CHEC-00] between Costa Rica's National Road Council [Consejo Nacional de Vialidad] (CONAVI) and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC), which was signed on June 3, 2013.  The purpose of the project is to expand a 107-kilometer section of National Route 32 from two to four lanes. This road section begins at the Route 4 junction at Fr\\u00edo river and extends to Puerto Lim\\u00f3n\\u2019s district center. National Route 32 connects San Jos\\u00e9 with the port of Lim\\u00f3n. 80% of Costa Rican exports and imports go through the ports of Mo\\u00edn and Lim\\u00f3n, as it is the main connection with the ports of the eastern United States, Europe, and South America.   CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. CONAVI issued an order to CHEC to commence work on November 20, 2017.  The project was originally expected to take 42 months from the start date. However, it has faced a variety of delays related to land expropriation, tree cutting and clearing activities, environmental challenges, relocation of utilities, archaeological studies at five locations, and also cultural and language barriers. The initial planned completion date was October 4, 2020. However, according to Service order (O.S.-7) issued by CONAVI to CHEC on January 6, 2020, indicating that the new deadline for completion of the project was March 27, 2021. Another service order (O.S.-11) issued by CONAVI on February 25 2021, indicated that the new deadline for completion of the project was May 22, 2022.

During the same month, the project's sponsor declared force majeure and stated that development would be delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, on March 24, 2020, it was reported that construction and labor negotiations were being delayed due to the COVID-19-related travel ban preventing employees of Guangdong Engineering from returning from China. Construction restarted in September 2020. The continuing construction of the coal power plant has caused controversy because it contradicts the Government Indonesia's pledge to shift to renewable energy sources.\",\"In 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the Government of Zambia signed a $104,009,785.90 buyer\\u2019s credit agreement for the Mfuwe International Airport Construction Project.

The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the loan under Proclamation No.988/2017 on December 27, 2016 and the proclamation went into effect on January 3. 2017. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 2.6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee.  The borrower is expected to use the loan proceeds to finance approximately 50% of the total cost of a ETB 4,168,889,036.14 commercial (EPC) contract between Addis Ababa Roads Authority (AACRA) and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). The remainder of the commercial contract cost is expected to be directly financed from the budget of City Administration of Addis Ababa.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $102,736,147.53  (ETB 2,286,586,782) loan achieved a 38% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single disbursement of ETB 861,595,457 on March 28, 2018.   The purpose of this project is support the construction of two subsidiary projects (\\u2018Lot 1\\u2019 and \\u2018Lot 2\\u2019). Lot 1 involves the construction of the 11 km Qality-Tulu Dimtu Ring Road Interchange (also known as the Kality Ring Road Interchange - Tulu Dimtu Roundabout and the Qality Ring Road Interchange-Tulu Dimtu Ring Road), which is located on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. Lot 1 also involves the construction of five bridges as well as the Akaki Bridge. Lot 2 involves the construction of the 10.6 km Qality Ring Road to Qilinto Road (also known as the Kality Ring Road - Kilinto Roundabout and Bole Bulbula project and the Qality ring road to Qilinto road project). Lot 2 will connect Bole Michael ring road and Qality ring road and thereby provide for easy transportation route for the goods from the Qilinto industrial zone. This road segment is also expected to be useful for the condominium residents in the area. Lot 2 also involves the construction of a 250 meter-span bridge as well as an underpass bridge. Since both road segments (Lots 1 and 2) are located in areas that are important for trade, they are expected to improve market access for small businesses and industrial parks.   IFH Engineering plc \\u2014 a wholly owned subsidiary of the CCCC \\u2014 is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and its work is being overseen by AACRA. ASER Construction also worked as a subcontractor for CCCC. Engineer Zewdie Eskinder and Company Plc. is responsible for providing consulting services for Lot 1. Hake Consultant Company is responsible for providing consulting services for Lot 2. A groundbreaking ceremony for Lot 1 and Lot 2 took place on February 14, 2017. As of April 2021, Lot 1 had achieved a 76% completion rate.   However, this project has faced local scrutiny and criticism due to the fact that it was reportedly among the most expensive road projects to ever be undertaken (in unit cost terms) in Ethiopia. Lot 1 costs ETB 222.7 million per kilometer of road and Lot 2 costs ETB 219.8 million per kilometer of road.  There are also indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Qality Ring Road Interchange Tulu Dimtu Roundabout Road and Qality Ring Road Bulbula-Qilinto Roundabout Road Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects (including the Qality Ring Road Interchange Tulu Dimtu Roundabout Road and Qality Ring Road Bulbula-Qilinto Roundabout Road Project) and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On April 7, 2006, a joint venture called Compagnie Mini\\u00e8re de Luisha (COMILU or \\u7eff\\u7eb1\\u77ff\\u4e1a\\u6709\\u9650\\u8d23\\u4efb\\u516c\\u53f8 or \\u7eff\\u7eb1\\u77ff\\u4e1a) was established by China Overseas Engineering Corporation (COVEC) and G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale des Carri\\u00e8res et des Mine SARL (G\\u00e9camines SARL) to mine 26.1 million tons of copper and cobalt deposits at the Luisha deposit (locational coordinates: -11.16889, 27.00917).

The IDB Invest Loan has an A/B structure in which the IDB Group funded a $300 million tranche (\\u201ctranche A\\u201d) and a group of international commercial banks and institutional investors from North America, Europe and Asia (CDPQ, KFW IPEX, BNP Paribas, ICBC, Sumitomo Mitsui, BBVA and Banco Santander) funded a $650 million tranche (\\u201ctranche B\\u201d). All members of the lending syndicate \\u2014 including ICBC \\u2014 that participated in tranche B reportedly contributed $108.3 million. ICBC\\u2019s contribution is captured via Project ID#54365. Additionally, the IDB Invest Loan included $50 million of resources from the China Co-Financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean, which is managed by IDB Invest).  Tranche A and the $50 million portion financed by the China Co-Financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (captured via Project ID#54637) have a total term (maturity) of 12 years and a grace period of 4 years, and tranche B has terms of 8 and 12 years. The loan proceeds will be disbursed gradually over a 4-year disbursement period. Interest on the IDB Invest Loan will accrue at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.125% and 2.75% payable semi-annually in arrears. EPM may voluntarily prepay the IDB Invest Loan at any time. All payment obligations under the IDB Invest Loan rank in all respects at least pari passu in priority of payment with all other present and future unsecured and unsubordinated external indebtedness of the borrower. The IDB Invest Loan provides for certain financial covenants, which are: the net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio must be greater than 4.0 and the interest coverage ratio to be less than 3.0. As of June 30, 2019, the total outstanding balance under this loan was Ps.1,398,234 million  The purpose of the project is to build a 2,400 MW (2 GW) hydropower facility and dam over the Cauca River \\u2014 the second largest river in the country \\u2014 in the northern region of Antioquia. The project consists of a 79 km long reservoir with a flood area of 3,800ha and an active capacity of 980 million cubic meters, and a 225 meter high earth-core rock-filled embankment dam with a volume of 20 million cubic meters. The dam will have a controlled spillway with a design flow of 22,600 cubic meters a second. The powerhouse will be underground with eight 300MW generating units, each driven by a headrace tunnel equipped with Francis turbines and vertical shaft synchronous generators. Water will be fed to the turbine chambers through eight tunnels. There will be two separate tunnels as well, for returning the water to the Cauca River. The hydraulic head of the power plant will be 197m. A 500kV main substation will be built outside the dam to transmit the power generated from the underground powerhouse. Upon completion, the Ituango hydropower plant will represent approximately 18 percent of the country\\u2019s total installed power capacity, and generate approximately 13,900 GWh of renewable electricity per year.  A consortium formed by the Camargo Correa (a Brazilian company), Colombians Conconcreto, and Coninsa is responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2011 and the project was originally scheduled to reach completion by the end of 2013. However, as of June 30, 2019, the project had achieved a physical progress rate of 72.7%. However, this project stalled in 2018 due to a geological event. To understand what happened, it is important to know how a dam is built. This process involves the construction of different tunnels to divert the water while raising the dam. As the project neared completion, EPM closed two of the three tunnels it had built. Then, on April 28, 2018 a landslide near the site blocked the remaining tunnel. With rain and new landslides, water rose to critical levels. That led EPM to what would be only one of a series of hard decisions: on May 10, 2018, the company flooded the dam\\u2019s turbine rooms to release the pressure being exerted on the structure by the river. Water levels were reduced, but all the equipment that had already been installed suffered irreversible damage. Two days later, one of the sealed tunnels ceded the pressure, unblocked and caused flash floods downstream. Over 113,000 people living downstream of the dam have already been evacuated, due to the risk of a collapse. Even today, the risk of new landslides from nearby mountains still remain, which could potentially compromise the integrity of the entire project. The attempt to save the dam includes the construction of a new project tunnel to reduce the levels of the flooded river, which would take several months. On December 12, 2018, IDB Invest granted EPM a waiver for its non-compliance with certain environmental covenants under the loan agreement caused by \\u2018the Ituango Contingency\\u2019. EPM and IDB Invest subsequently began negotiating an amendment to the loan agreement to revise the environmental covenants.\",\"On December 24, 2015, CDB signed an export seller's credit agreement worth RMB 700 million ($108 million) with VimpelCom Holdings (Beeline trademark) \\u2014 a Russian telecommunications company \\u2014 to finance the purchase of Huawei equipment.

The borrowing terms of the PBC (loan) are as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 7-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity.  The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance an EPC contract with Shanghai Construction Group (SCG). China Eximbank made a single loan disbursement in 2021 worth $25,276,460. The lender was originally scheduled to make additional disbursements worth $31,595,575 in 2022, $50,552,920 in 2023, and $18,957,345 in 2024.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 114 km stretch of National Road No.71 (known as National Road No.71 C) connecting Chamkar Leu district Kampong Cham province and Kroch Chhmar district, Tbong Khmum district, and some parts of Tambor district of Tbong Khmum province. Shanghai Construction Group (SCG) is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   Project implementation officially commenced on November 23, 2021. The originally expected project completion date was December 31, 2024 and was scheduled to end simultaneously with the Cambodia-China Stung Trang-Kroch Chhmar Friendship Bridge. However, it has encountered multiple delays and problems, including land acquisition issues and the COVID-19 pandemic.\",\"On June 27, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia signed a $129,734,105.49 million buyer\\u2019s credit (loan) agreement for the 122 km Kawambwa to Mporokoso (D019) Road Upgrade Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of a $142.28 million commercial contact between Zambia's Road Development Agency and China Harbour Engineering Limited, Ltd (CHEC), which was signed in July 2016. As of July 2022, the loan from China Eximbank had achieved a 10.1% disbursement rate ($13,219,206.11 out of $129,734,105.49).    The purpose of the project is to upgrade a 122 km stretch of the D019 road between Kawambwa to Mporokoso from gravel to the bituminous standard. CHEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 27, 2017. However, virtually no progress was made during 2018, with a project completion rate of 2%. Consequently, the project\\u2019s intended completion date was pushed back until July 23, 2021. According the Zambian Road Development Agency's 2020 Work Plan, construction is ongoing, but a March 9, 2020 media report says the project experienced further delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   This project has also been plagued by allegations of corruption. In June 2019, Christopher Siwakwi, an investigations officer from Zambia\\u2019s Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), told the Lusaka Magistrates\\u2019 Court that foreign currency (USD) moved from a CHEC bank account to purchase two properties allegedly owned by Zambian Infrastructure and Housing Minister Ronald Chitotela. Siwakwi, however, testified that the properties \\u2014 lot number 148 of farm 50A and subdivision A of lot 22183 /M  Ibex Hill \\u2014 were established to be in the names of the previous owners, Mary Lubinga and Former Labour Minister Austin Liato.  Ronald Chitotela, Gregory Chibanga and Brut Holdings were charged with two counts of concealing the two properties while Diris Mukange was charged with two counts of possession of the same properties, which are suspected to be proceeds of crime. They all pled not guilty. During the trial before principal resident magistrate David Simusamba, Christopher Siwakwi said his investigations established that the contract for the sale of the properties was in the name of Diris Mukange (as a buyer for both properties), while the negotiations for the prices were done by Ronald Chitotela and his wife when he was Deputy Minister for Sports and Youth Development. Siwakwi said the price of the property in Makeni was K1.6 million while the Ibex Hill one was purchased at K1.8 million, adding that the source of income to buy the same was tracked back to CHEC. Siwakwi recounted how ACC in June 2017 received a complaint that Ronald Chitotela was in possession of property suspected to have been proceeds of crime and had received a bribe from CHEC. Siwakwi said ACC also received additional information that the money used to purchase the properties originated from CHEC. Siwakwi said the ACC team embarked on investigations to establish whether the allegations were founded. Siwakwi said he visited the Bank of China where he established that China Harbour had a U.S. dollar account with the bank which transferred $300,000 to Andrews and Partners on July 27, 2016 at its FNB bank account which was payment for legal services and attached to the bank statement was a contract for the upgrading of Kawambwa-Mporokoso road.   On July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the loan\\u2019s undisbursed balance ($116,514,899.38); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities\\u2019 request for a debt treatment under \\u2018the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI\\u2019 endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club.\",\"On May 7, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Indonesia signed a $130,387,425.76 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for Phase 3 of the Cileunyi-Sumedang-Dawuan Toll Road Project (captured in Project ID#61397).   Funding for Phase 1 of the Cileunyi-Sumedang-Dawuan Toll Road was signed on November 12, 2012 between the China Exim Bank and the Government of Indonesia worth $92,999,886.66 in preferential buyer's credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO.

The PBC, which went into effect on March 11, 2013, carried the following terms: 15-year maturity, 3-year grace period, 3% interest rate, and 0.2% management fee. On March 3, 2016, the closing date of the PBC agreement was extended from March 11, 2016 to August 28, 2017. Then, on August 28, 2017, the PBC agreement was again extended from August 28, 2017 to December 21, 2017. As of December 21, 2017, $84,693,920 of the $92,999,886.66 PBC had been disbursed.  On June 13, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Indonesia signed a $219,398,580 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO (2015) TOTAL NO (389)] for Phase 2 of the Cileunyi-Sumedang-Dawuan Toll Road Project (captured in Project ID#39363). The PBC, which went into effect on September 30, 2016, carried the following terms: 15-year maturity, 3-year grace period, 3% interest rate, 0.2% commitment fee, and 0.2% management fee. The closing date of this PBC agreement is June 13, 2021.  The Cileunyi-Sumedang-Dawuan Toll Road \\u2014 also known as the Cisumdawu Toll Road \\u2014  is a road that, upon completion, will pass through Cileunyi, Tanjung Sari, Sumedang, Cimalaka, Legok, Ujung Jaya and Kertajati. It will connect Padaleunyi Toll Road with Palimanan-Kanci Toll Road. It will also connect Bandung with Kertajati International Airport, which opened in 2018. The road is being built in 6 sections. Section I (or Phase 1): Cileunyi\\u2013Tanjungsari (12.0 km); Section II (or Phase 2): Tanjungsari\\u2013Sumedang (17.5 km); Section III (or Phase 3): Sumedang\\u2013Cimalaka (3.7 km); Section IV (or Phase 4): Cimalaka\\u2013Legok (7.2 km); Section V (or Phase 5): Legok\\u2013Ujungjaya (15.9 km); and Section VI (Phase 5): Ujungjaya\\u2013Dawuan (4.0 km).   A consortium of Chinese and Indonesian companies \\u2014 including the Shanghai Construction Group, Wijaya Karya and Waskita Karya \\u2014 are responsible for building all the sections of the toll road. However, the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and Housing, China MCC17 Group Co Ltd, and MCC Overseas Ltd are also involved in project implementation. A formal project commencement ceremony took place on November 29, 2012. As of June 2019, the project was still under implementation. The project was originally expected to be complete by end-2021. On January 15, 2021, the head of the West Java Transportation Office, Hery Antasari, said the toll road project has been held up by the slow process of land clearing on Section VI. In a written statement on Monday, January 24, 2022, West Java Governor Ridwan Kamil said the Cileunyi - Sumedang - Dawuan or Cisumdawu toll road construction project will be finished and connected to the Cipali Toll Road in June 2022.\",\"On October 29, 2021, Mexico's CEMEX secured financial close on a US$3.25 billion sustainability-linked, dollar-denominated, unsecured syndicated financing package.

The exact locational coordinates of the power plant are 31\\u00b016\\u203208\\u2033N 36\\u00b026\\u203252\\u2033E. It was envisaged that the plant would utilize Jordan\\u2019s vast reserves of oil shale and help reduce the country\\u2019s reliance upon imports of oil products for power generation. Upon completion, this plant was expected to consume around 10 million tons of oil shale per year and generate 470 megawatts of baseload power by 2021. The plant would reportedly generate enough power to meet 10-15% of Jordan's electricity needs (about 3.7 billion kWh). NEPCO would act as the plant\\u2019s sole offtaker. The total cost of this project was $2.11 billion and it was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.   On March 16, 2017, a consortium of four Chinese state-owned banks signed a $1.582 billion syndicated loan agreement with Attarat Power Company (APCO) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and project company that is owned by YTL Power International Bhd of Malaysia (45% ownership stake), Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd of China (45% ownership stake), and Eesti Energia AS (Enefit) of Estonia (10% ownerships stake) \\u2014 for the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project. The syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit loan reportedly consisted of a $594 million contribution from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (captured in Project ID#52552), a $594 million contribution from Bank of China (captured in Project ID#72499), a $244 million contribution from China Construction Bank (captured in Project ID#72500), and a $150 million contribution from China Eximbank (captured in Project ID#72502). The borrowing terms were as follows: a 15 year maturity and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.426% in March 2017) plus a 3% margin. Sinosure provided buyer\\u2019s credit insurance to the the borrower. An extensive security package was also provided to the lenders that covers all of the infrastructure and materials required to operate the plant, including over the valuable land concession from the Government of Jordan.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that APCO signed with Guangdong Power Engineering Corporation (GPEC) \\u2014 a subsidiary of China Energy Engineering Corporation \\u2014 on October 31, 2014. Under the terms of this EPC contract, GPEC agreed to undertake, on a turnkey basis, the design, engineering, procurement, construction, erection, interconnection, commissioning, start-up, testing, completion, placing in operation and delivery of the oil shale fired electric generation plant. Foster Wheeler was responsible for the provision of the circulating fluidized bed boilers. Siemens was responsible for the provision of steam turbine generators. Worley Parsons was responsible or the design of the power plant. In addition to the debt financing that was used to support this project, the shareholders in APCO agreed to provide \\u2018base shareholder funding\\u2019 (i.e. equity investments) of up to $528 million. These equity contributions were announced on March 16, 2017 after Enefit of Estonia and Near East Investment sold a 15% equity stake in APCO to YTL Power International Bhd and a 45% equity stake in APCO to Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd (see Project ID#64457). Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd is a Chinese state-owned utility that is jointly owned by Guangdong Province (76% equity stake) and China Huaneng Group (24% equity stake).   As of 2017, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project was the largest private sector investment and example of limited recourse financing in Jordan\\u2019s history. Upon completion, it was expected to have 554MW of gross power generation capacity and 477MW of net power generation capacity. It was expected to consist of two circulating-fluidized-bed units and draw oil shale from a nearby open cast mine. It was expected to employ 5,500 individuals (including 2,000 Chinese nationals) during the construction phase and 1,000 individuals each year after the construction phase is completed. On March 16, 2017, APCO issued a \\u2018notice to proceed\\u2019 to the EPC contractor (GPEC). Then, on March 20, 2017, construction began. Project implementation was suspended for two months during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, construction resumed in May 2020.   The project is ultimately expected to deliver power generation capacity in two phases: 235MW in 2020 and 235MW in 2021. APCO has entered into a 30-year agreement with NEPCO for the sale of the plant\\u2019s entire power generation capacity following its construction. The 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant project is expected to deliver capacity in two phases, 235 MW in 2H 2020 and 235 MW in 1H 2021. Unit 1 of the 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant, which also includes an open-cast mine, was synchronized with Jordan\\u2019s national grid on May 26, 2021. As of the same date, the entire project had achieved a 96% completion rate. However, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project has become a source of local controversy. To facilitate repayment of the loan (and provide a financial return to its equity holder), APCO entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with National Electric Power Corporation (NEPCO), the Jordanian state-owned power utility. NEPCO agreed to serve as the sole offtaker (i.e., single buyer) and purchase all power generated by the oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat at a price of approximately $0.17 per kilowatt hour (kWh). However, NEPCO signed several other PPAs with private companies around the same time, which resulted in too much power generation capacity and not enough customers.   As of late 2021, many of APCO\\u2019s competitors were selling electricity at $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which put NEPCO between a rock and a hard place: it is contractually obligated to purchase power from APCOM at $0.17 per kWh without enough customers to whom it can resell the power.  On December 19, 2020, NEPCO and the Government of Jordan (GOJ) initiated international arbitration proceedings against APCO with respect to the PPA and the GOJ guarantee of NEPCO\\u2019s payment obligations. NEPCO and the GOJ sought declaratory judgments that (a) the $0.17 per kWh tariff is \\u2018grossly unfair\\u2019 and (b) NEPCO can terminate the PPA if its \\u2018gross unfairness\\u2019 is not addressed. APCO has insisted that its loan agreement with ICBC, China Eximbank, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank was based on an internal rate of return (IRR) calculation of 17% (which in turn is based on the $0.17 per kWh tariff) and that it won\\u2019t be able to repay its debts if the IRR and tariff rate are downwardly revised.\",\"On March 25, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone signed a framework agreement with a consortium of Chinese companies \\u2014 consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd., China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd. \\u2014 regarding the design and construction of the works necessary for the expansion and upgrading of Port Elizabeth II in Freetown Port (also known as \\u2018Queen Elizabeth II Port\\u2019). Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd.

On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower\\u2019s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.\\u2019s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the \\u2018New Port\\u2019 (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData\\u2019s \\u2018Staff Comments\\u2019). Sierra Leone\\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (\\u6cf0\\u5bcc\\u91cd\\u88c5\\u96c6), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidfore will collect a \\u2018development levy fee,\\u2019 which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone\\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower\\u2019s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone\\u2019s contingent liability).  The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.  This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project\\u2014National Port Development (SL) Ltd.\\u2014was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone\\u2019s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone\\u2019s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country\\u2019s GDP) on the government\\u2019s books.\",\"On December 23, 2014, China Development Bank issued a $135,750,000 loan to State Grid Brazil Holding S.A. for its subsidiary Itumbiara Transmissora de Energia S.A. (ITE). The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.65% and a 6-year maturity (final maturity date: September 24, 2020). The borrower was responsible for making interest payments in 11 semi-annual installments from June 20, 2015 to September 24, 2020.  By way of background, in December 2010, State Grid Corporation of China acquired 100% stakes in seven Brazilian transmission concession companies through its wholly owned Brazilian subsidiary, State Grid Brazil Holding S.A. (\\u201cSGBH\\u201d), each with a secured 30-year operating right. The assets in these companies at the time of acquisition included transmission lines with a total length of 3,176 km, six 500 kV substations, two 500 kV switching stations and one 345 kV substation. SGBH assumed responsibility for operating these 7 transmission companies. Then, in May 2012, SGBH entered into an agreement to acquire another seven Brazilian transmission concession companies, each with a secured 30-year operating right. The seven companies\\u2019 assets at the time of acquisition included transmission lines with a total length of 2,792 km, 11 self-owned substations and 12 substations jointly controlled with others. These activities and other electricity transmission projects \\u2014 including the 2,518 km Belo Monte \\u00b1800 kV UHVDC Transmission Project (or \\u5df4\\u897f\\u7f8e\\u4e3d\\u5c71\\u6c34\\u7535\\u7279\\u9ad8\\u538b\\u76f4\\u6d41\\u9001\\u51fa\\u4e8c\\u671f\\u9879 or \\u00b1800\\u5343\\u4f0f\\u7279\\u9ad8\\u538b\\u76f4\\u6d41\\u8f93\\u7535\\u5de5\\u7a0b) \\u2014 have been supported by China Development through a series of loans.\",\"On July 31, 2009, China National Electrical Engineering Company (CNEEC) and the Government of Zambia signed a Letter of Intent, which outlined the possibility that CNEEC would work with ZESCO Limited to develop the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project (captured via Project ID#57392) and the 15MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project (captured via Project ID#30467). In exchange for hiring CNEEC, the Government of Zambia requested that China Eximbank extend a preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) for both projects and that CNEEC arrange the financing. In 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia signed a $183.23 million PBC agreement for the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project and the 15MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. According to a 2014 report from Zambia\\u2019s Office of the Auditor General (source ID#67159), the proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance (a) 85% ($139,353,132) of the cost of a commercial contract ($163,944,861.43) between ZESCO Limited and CNEEC for the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project, which was signed on July 21, 2011; and (b)  85% ($44.2 million) of the cost of a commercial contract ($52 million) between ZESCO Limited and CNEEC for the 14.8MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project, which was signed on July 21, 2011. The remaining 15% was to be provided by the Government of Zambia in counterpart financing.   The 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project involves the upgrading of the Lusiwasi Hydroelectric Power Plant, which is located in Serenje District and Central Province (exact locational coordinates: -13.34642,31.01898), from from 12MW to 86MW. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on September 7, 2014.  However, it has faced major implementation delays and become a source of local controversy. One source of concern that emerged was overpricing and the fact that the CNEEC was selected as the contractor through a sole-source contract rather than through a competitive bidding process. Additionally, a Government of Zambia inquiry into CNEEC\\u2019s background revealed that the company did not perform to the required standards of good workmanship and quality delivery on previous contracts. ZESCO Limited eventually notified CNEEC of its intentions to terminate their commercial contract. Then, in October 2011, Government of Zambia made the decision to terminate the commercial contract with CNEEC. However, CNEEC was not willing to refund an advance payment of $32,334,632.75 that ZESCO Limited provided between December 21, 2010 and August 23, 2011. Upon consultation between the Government of Zambia and ZESCO Limited, it was decided that the commercial contract would be reinstated in order to avoid the additional costs that would arise from termination. More specifically, a \\\"no-objection\\\" was granted as per China Eximbank's request. Upon reinstating CNEEC in June 2012, ZESCO Limited agreed with CNEEC that the implementation would start with the 14.8MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project, and upon completion of that project, the contractor would proceed to implement the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project. As of 2017, the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project had only achieved a 48% completion rate (against a target rate of 90%). There is also some reporting that suggests that PowerChina (Sinohydro) may have replaced CNEEC as the contractor responsible for the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project.\",\"On January 4, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Mauritania signed a $138,300,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the 140MW Gouina Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. This PBC, which is captured via Project ID#56791, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate.    The purpose of the project was to establish a 140MW hydroelectric power plant in Gouina on the Senegal River.  The project involved the construction of a concrete dam with a threshold spilling over its entire width; the construction of a hydroelectric plant with three power generation units capable of producing 620 GWh per year; the construction of a 287 meter long intake canal and a 423 meter long escape canal; the rehabilitation of the existing track and the bridge at the Cimenterie de Diamou; and the construction of a 225-kilovolt high-voltage line connecting the Gouina station to the Medina station not far from Kayes. The Government of Senegal, the Government of Mali, and the Government of Mauritania all contributed to the implementation of this project. The total cost of the project was approximately $437 million and the Government of Senegal, the Government of Mali, and the Government of Mauritania all contracted equally sized loans (approximately $138,300,000) with China Eximbank to facilitate the implementation of the project. The China Eximbank loan (PBC) contracted by the Government of Mali is captured via Project ID#53100. The China Eximbank loan (PBC) contracted by the Government of Senegal is captured via Project ID#53179. These proceeds from these 3 China Eximbank loans covered 95% of the total cost of the project. The remaining 5% was covered by Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve S\\u00e9n\\u00e9gal (OMVS), which is also known as the Senegal River Basin Authority.   Sinohydro Corporation Engineering Bureau 15 Co, Ltd was the contractor responsible for implementation. A foundation stone laying ceremony took place on December 17, 2013. However, construction did not begin until October 1, 2016. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2018, but it was ultimately completed when all 3 power generation units were connected to the grid on April 3, 2022. An official dam inauguration ceremony took place on December 3, 2022.\",\"On May 19, 2013, China Development Bank (CDB) and Zijin Mining Group signed a loan agreement with JV Zeravshan LLC (formerly known as Zervashan Gold Company) -- a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd (70% equity stake) and the Government of Tajikistan (30% equity stake) -- worth $140 million. The proceeds from the loan were to be used for the Technological Innovation of ZGC Gold Mine in Tajikistan, a project that aimed to expand the production capacity of a gold mine in the town of Panjakent within Zarafshon in northern Tajikistan.  As of March 28, 2014, the project had entered implementation and achieved the following objectives: (1) the stripping of infrastructure of Jilao open-pit mine and Taror openpit mine had been completed for over 90% and 80%, respectively; (2) the reformation of industrial pilot production processing technology of Taror oxide ore processing plant had been completed; and (3) the Jilao 10,000 tonnes processing plant project had entered into civil engineering construction and installation stage. Upon completion, the project was expected to increase the mine's production to 3.5 tonnes of gold per year.\",\"On November 26, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Serbia signed an EUR 134,300,000 loan agreement [No. BLA20210340034)] for the State Road of 1B Category No. 27 Loznica-Valjevo-Lazarevac, Section Iverak-Lajkovac (Intersection on the Highway E-763 Belgrade-Pozega) Construction Project.  The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR plus 2.35% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.5% commitment fee, a 0.5% (EUR 671,500) management fee, an 7.1% (EUR 9,584,786.19) Sinosure credit insurance premium.  The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between China Shandong International Economic and Technical Cooperation Group, Ltd. of Shandong Hi-Speed Group Co. Ltd., the Government of the Republic of Serbia (represented by the Ministry of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure) and the Public Enterprise \\u201cRoads of Serbia\\u201d, which was signed on June 10, 2020.   The lender made disbursements worth $63,982,000 in 2022. The loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding was $0 as of December 31, 2021 and $63,982,000 as of September 31, 2022.   The purpose of the project is to construct a two-way, four lane State Road that passes through Valjevo (Popucke, Lukavac, Divci, Klanica, Loznica and Veselinovac), and Lajkovac (Slovac, Markova Crkva,Ratkovac and Nepricava). The road has a total expected length of 18.3 km, and the maximum allowed speed of 100 km per hour. There are 20 bridges (including 4 large bridges, and 16 medium and small bridges), with a total length of about 2.5 km (among which, 1.83 km for 4 large bridges, and 0.51 km for 16 medium and small bridges).   Construction commenced in June 2020. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic visited the project site near the town of Klanica on March 23, 2021. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2022.\",\"On September 4, 2018, Bank of China (BOC) and the Government of Angola signed a $148,721,360 buyer's credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Luanda New International Airport Railway Branch Line Project. The BCL agreement entered into force on September 4, 2018 but it is unclear when the financing agreement itself was signed. The borrowing terms of the loan are also unknown. Sinosure provided insurance for this loan. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $162,473,143 commercial (EPC) contract signed on July 10, 2017 between Angola\\u2019s Ministry of Transportation, China Hyway Group Limited, and Tianjin Oubaiwei Corp. Ltd.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 17.4 km rail link between New Luanda International Airport (also known as New Angola International Airport or NAIL) and Luanda City. More specifically, it involves the construction of a second railway line between Baia station and NAIL that runs parallel to the existing Luanda Railway Line known as Caminho-de-Ferro de Luanda (CFL). China Hyway Group Limited and Tianjin Oubaiwei Corp. Ltd. are the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. Construction began on July 10, 2017. Then, on February 3, 2022, the first 32-meter T beam of the airport bridge was laid. ICBC also financed the construction of this airport (as captured via Project ID#65402). This project is closely related to the 2016 Bungo-Baia Double Railway Track Construction Project (see Project ID#67414).\",\"On February 28, 2017, China Eximbank signed an a buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement with Cameroon's Ministry of Power and Water Resources worth $141,839,830 for Phase 2 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of the BCL are as follows: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 320 basis points. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL to partially finance the cost of a commercial contract between Cameroon\\u2019s Ministry of Water and Energy and Sinohydro Corporation. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 90.9% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 6.9 billion) and the its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 69.1 billion.   The purpose of the project is to evacuate 211MW of electricity from the Memve'ele dam (on River Ntem) to Yaounde. The project scope includes (1) the construction of 294 pylons between Nyabizan and Ebolowa; (2) the installation of a 225kV, 280 km electricity transmission line between Nyabissan (Memve'ele), Ebolowa and Ahala substations; (3) deviation of the existing 225kV Mangomb\\u00e9-Oyomabang single-circuit electricity transmission line and the existing 90kV Ed\\u00e9a-Yaound\\u00e9 single-circuit electricity transmission line; (4) the construction of two new Ebolowa and Nkol Nkumu 225kV substations; and (5) extension of the existing Ahala substation from 90kV to 225kV. Upon completion, these transmission lines to Ebolowa and substations are expected to connect the dam to Cameroon\\u2019s southern network and to Yaound\\u00e9. Sinohydro 16th Bureau is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project construction began in 2011 and the dam was completed since June 2017, but energy evacuation works are being built and it is expected to be announced in August 2020.  As of September 30, 2021, the construction of the Nyabizan-Yaound\\u00e9 evacuation line had achieved a 92% completion rate (and at least 280 of the 294 pylons were installed). However, the completion of the project (commissioning of the dam) depends on payment of compensation to the people affected by the transmission line\\u2019s corridor.  The people located along a 5 km route of this 270 km line are claiming nearly FCFA 3 billion (EUR 5 million) in compensation, and as of December 2021, this issue had not been resolved (after several failed attempts and deadlines). In late June 2021, during a special plenary session of the National Assembly, Cameroon\\u2019s Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Essomba provided an update on the status of the project. He explained that \\u201cMemve\\u2019ele hydroelectric plant is already injecting 90MW of energy into the South Interconnected Network\\u201d and \\u201conce the 225kV line is completed [\\u2026] the volume of production injected will rise to 211 MW.\\u201d However, according to Sinohydro 16th Bureau, the hydroelectric power plant will not operate at full capacity after the completion of the 280 km electricity transmission line between Nyabizan and Ebolowa because of the flow of the Ntem River.  The company\\u2019s experts believe claim that the flow of the Ntem River will not be sufficient to regularly drive the power plant\\u2019s four (52.75 MW) turbines.   The solution suggested by Sinohydro 16th Bureau is the construction of a reservoir and the project is reportedly being \\u2018fine-tuned\\u2019 to address this issue. According to the Government of Cameroon, the revenue generated by the Memve\\u2019ele hydroelectric power plant and Nyabizan-Yaound\\u00e9 transmission line since \\u2018powering up\\u2019 from April 2019 to October 2021 amounts to CFAF 45 billion. In addition, the partial completion of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project enabled the shutdown of the Ahala, Oyom-Abang, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa thermal power stations, which has led to a substantial reduction in the fuel costs that were previously borne by the Government of Cameroon. Phase 1 of the project was also financed by China Eximbank in 2012 and completed in 2016 (as captured via Project ID#289).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon \\u2014 with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 \\u2014 by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) \\u2014 or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon\\u2019s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini \\u00e0 Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.\\u2019\",\"On March 1, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Mongolia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Ulaanbaatar Central Wastewater Treatment Plant Construction Project. The GCL, captured via Project ID#69003, carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. Then, on January 20, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Mongolia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance signed a $249,574,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Ulaanbaatar Central Wastewater Treatment Plant Construction Project. The PBC, captured via Project ID#91228, carries a 2% interest rate and an unknown maturity and grace period. It came into force on April 20, 2020. The proceeds of the GCL are to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group (CTCE) and Beijing Construction Engineering Group (BCEG). The proceeds of the PBC are to be used by the borrower to finance 95% of the cost of a $262.7 million commercial contract with First Engineering Co Ltd of China Railway No 4 Engineering Group Co Ltd (CREC4).   The purpose of the project is to construct a wastewater treatment plant \\u2014 with a daily capacity of 250,000 cubic meters of wastewater \\u2014 on a 40-hectare site in Ulaanbaatar\\u2019s 20th subdistrict of Songinokharkhan district. A formal project commencement ceremony was held during Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi\\u2019s visit to Mongolia on August 27, 2018. Then, on February 28, 2019, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. Works were originally scheduled to last 36 months (expected completion date: February 28, 2022). However, project implementation stalled in mid-2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, in July 2020, 24 technicians arrived to guide CTCE employees stationed there to resume con\\u00adstruction. Construction restarted in August 2020. One month later, in September 2020, local engineering and technical staff were preparing the site for the construction of the first of the two biological treatment blocks. By August 2021, the project had achieved a 28 percent completion rate. Successful concrete pouring into the inner walls of three reaction tanks took place on March 31, 2022. The wastewater plant is currently scheduled to be handed over and put into operation on February 28, 2025.  To date, the project has reportedly employed 50 foreign workers and 450 Mongolian workers.\",\"On June 22, 2003, China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (CATIC) issued a $67.77 million supplier\\u2019s credit (loan) to the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) \\u2014 an Iranian state-owned enterprise \\u2014 to acquire four 74,000-ton bulk carriers from Jiangnan Shipyard in China. The agreement was signed by Liu Jun, general manager of AVIC Beijing, Hu Keyi, chief engineer of Jiangnan Shipyard, and AFKHAMI, president of IRISL. It appears that CATIC, in turn, secured an export seller\\u2019s credit from a Chinese state-owned bank in order to finance the supplier credit.    The proceeds from the supplier credit were to be used by the borrower to finance 80% of the cost of a $84.72 million commercial contract with CATIC. The first carrier was scheduled for delivery in January 2006 with a new carrier being delivered every 3 months thereafter until IRISL received all four carriers. There is evidence that at least several of the carriers were successfully delivered to IRISL. However, precise delivery dates are unavailable.\",\"On November 25, 2015, the Government of Colombia's National Infrastructure Agency (ANI) signed a 25-year design-build-finance-operate-maintain (DBFOM) concession agreement with Autopistas Urab\\u00e1 S.A.S., giving it the right to finance, design, construct, operate, and maintain a 254 km toll road (known as Autopista al Mar 2). The total estimated cost of this public-private partnership (PPP) project is $891 million and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. On July 24, 2019, China Development Bank (Shandong Branch) and Autopistas Urab\\u00e1 S.A.S. \\u2014 a project company (special purpose vehicle) that is jointly owned by China Harbour Engineering Company Limited Colombia (65% equity stake), SP Ingenieros S.A.S. (20% equity stake), Unidad de Infraestructura y Construcciones Asociadas S.A.S. or UNICA (15% equity stake), and Termot\\u00e9cnica Coindustrial S.A.S. (5% equity stake) \\u2014 signed a $417.7 million loan agreement for the Autopista al Mar 2 Project. CDB provided the loan proceeds in two separate tranches: a $267.7 million tranche (known as Tranche A) with a 12 year maturity, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.05% margin (during the construction phase), a 2% management fee, a 1.2% commitment fee, and a 0.54% arrangement fee (captured via Project ID#54591); and a $150 million tranche (known as Tranche B) with a 16 year maturity, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin (during the construction phase), a 2% management fee, a 1.2% commitment fee, and a 0.54% arrangement fee (captured via Project ID#89458). As a source of security (collateral), the Government of Colombia guaranteed a minimum level of toll collection revenue (known as VPIP) over a 25-29 year period. In total, Autopistas Urab\\u00e1 S.A. secured approximately $652 million of debt financing for the Autopista al Mar 2 Project, including an $84 million loan from Sumitomo Mitsui Bank Corporation (SMBC) and a COP 500 billion (approximately $150 million) loan from Financiera de Desarrollo Nacional S. A. (FDN). The SMBC loan carries a 16 year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.05% margin (during construction). The FDN loan carries a 16 year maturity an interest rate of CPI plus a 7.5% margin.  The loan proceeds are to be used by the borrower (Autopistas Urab\\u00e1 S.A.S.) to finance a commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with a consortium (consisting of China Harbour Engineering Company Limited Colombia, SP Ingenieros S.A.S., Unidad de Infraestructura y Construcciones Asociadas S.A.S., and Termot\\u00e9cnica Coindustrial S.A.S.) on July 17, 2019. Paul Hastings LLP was the law firm that represented the syndicate of lenders. With trade tensions between the US and China escalating, CHEC took the decision to switch the documentation for the deal from New York law to English law. The switch meant taking on new sets of lawyers and making sure the contract documentation aligned with English law. The Autopista al Mar 2 Project involves a 254 km toll road that will connect Ca\\u00f1asgordas to Necocl\\u00ed, in Antioqu\\u00eda, a department in north-west Colombia. Under the terms of the concession agreement, Autopistas Urab\\u00e1 S.A.S. is responsible for upgrading the section of the highway between Ca\\u00f1asgordas and Uramita (28km); constructing a new highway segment between Uramita and Dabeiba (17.7km), while operating and maintaining the existing road connection; upgrading the road linking Dabeiba to Mutat\\u00e1 (53km); rehabiliating the highway linking Mutat\\u00e1 to El Tigre (47km); and operatiing and maintaining the existing highway between El Tigre and Necocl\\u00ed (106km). The Autopista al Mar 2 project also involves the construction of 62 bridges and 12 tunnel stretches. China Harbour Engineering Company Limited Colombia, SP Ingenieros S.A.S., Unidad de Infraestructura y Construcciones Asociadas S.A.S., and Termot\\u00e9cnica Coindustrial S.A.S are the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. Construction reportedly commenced in August 2018. However, the first CDB loan disbursements (Tranche A and Tranche B) did not take place until November 5, 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed project implementation. However, as of September 2021, the project had achieved a 58% completion rate. The construction phase of the Autopista al Mar 2 Project is expected to end in June 2022. In April 2022, all of the tunnels in this project was completed.\",\"On October 31, 2012, the Chinese Government and the Government of Guyana signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Cheddi Jagan International Airport Expansion Project. Then, on November 2, 2012, the Government of Guyana and China Eximbank signed an RMB 825,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. (2012) 32 Total No. (434) No. 1420203052012112030] for the Cheddi Jagan International Airport Expansion Project. The GCL (loan) carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 20 year maturity, a management fee of 0.75% (RMB 6,187,500), and a commitment fee of 0.5%. As of December 31, 2020, the loan\\u2019s total amount outstanding (including principal and capitalized interest) was RMB 673,698,000. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance 94.2% of the cost of a $138,000,000 commercial contract between Guyana\\u2019s Ministry of Public Works and Communications and China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) Ltd., which was signed on November 11, 2011.  The purpose of this project was to expand Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri, 40 km from the capital city of Georgetown, and the Ogle Municipal Aerodrome on the East Coast of Demerara. Cheddi Jagan International Airport is Guyana's main airport. The project involved a 3.3 km extension of the airport runaway to accommodate Boeing 747-sized aircraft, the building of a new construction terminal, the introduction of a departure control system, the installation of a CCTV system with approximately 300 cameras, the installation of passenger boarding bridges, elevators, and escalators, and the acquisition of new equipment. The existing 7,448 ft long runway was to be extended to 10,800 ft to make it a category Code 4E runway and to enable it to accommodate the Boeing 747-400 aircraft.   CHEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on March 23, 2013. Construction of the terminal and runway was originally expected to begin in March 2013 and reach completion 32 months later (December 2015). However, this project encountered various problems and delays. On October 12, 2013, CHEC employees were violently robbed by cutlass-wielding individuals (Source ID: 151254). Then, in September 2015, the collapse of a pit killed a worker working on the project (Source ID: 151255). The country's political opposition also raised objections about the cost of the project and delayed its implementation. In January 2015, the then Alliance for Change (AFC) Vice Chairman, Moses Nagamootoo, criticized the project in the media. It appears the AFC, then-an opposition party, was opposed to the project, supporting its abandonment for a new airport on the West Bank of Demerara at Sandhills. The opposition blocked funding for the project in 2014. Nagamootoo called the project a \\u2018fly by night project\\u2019, and was accused of misleading the public as to why Guyana used China Eximbank to finance the project. Nagamootoo later that year was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Guyana. (Source ID: 151253). As of 2019, the project was still not complete and the Government of Guyana's contract with China Harbour Engineering Company expired on December 31, 2018. In 2019, Guyana's Auditor General, Deodat Sharma, launched a full value-for-money audit into the Cheddi Jagan International Airport (CJIA) Expansion Project. Significant concerns arose about the project running over budget. As of December 31, 2017, $111.79 million had been spent on the project. However, the total cost of the project eventually escalated to more than $160 million. As of December 2021, project implementation was still underway and Guyana\\u2019s Minister of Public Works, Juan Edghill, promised that the total cost for the project would not exceed $200 million. During a visit to the project site in September 2020, the country\\u2019s former Auditor General, Anand Goolsarran, pointed out that President Irfaan Ali had identified 71 defects that needed to be rectified. President Irfaan conveyed that the Government of Guyana would only accept completed works based on the original contract entered into in November 2011. Then, in April 2022, Anand Goolsarran told the media that the Cheddi Jagan International Airport Expansion Project had \\u2018failed completely\\u2019 to deliver in terms of their objectives, outputs, outcomes and impacts, thereby \\u2018encumbering the Guyana\\u2019s public debt [\\u2026] with little or nothing to show for the expenditure incurred\\u2019. He noted that construction was still ongoing after ten years, with a revised completion date of June 20, 2022. He argued that project\\u2019s underperformance was related to the absence of feasibility and economic visibility studies prior to the issuing of the commercial contract (to determine the precise nature and scope of the works to be undertaken. He also noted that the project had suffered from a lack of effective supervision as the works progressed. Additionally, he pointed out that the $138 million commercial contract was awarded to CHEC in November 2011 \\u2014 only ten days before the November 2011 national and regional elections.\",\"On November 17, 2014, China Development Bank issued a $153,636,799 loan to State Grid Brazil Holding S.A. for its subsidiary Serra da Mesa Transmissora de Energia S.A. (SMTE). The loan carried an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2.85% margin, a 9 year maturity, and no grace period. Payments of principal and interest were scheduled in 19 semi-annual installments, beginning on December 20, 2014 and ending on September 5, 2023 (the loan's final maturity date).   By way of background, in December 2010, State Grid Corporation of China acquired 100% stakes in seven Brazilian transmission concession companies through its wholly owned Brazilian subsidiary, State Grid Brazil Holding S.A. (\\u201cSGBH\\u201d), each with a secured 30-year operating right. The assets in these companies at the time of acquisition included transmission lines with a total length of 3,176 km, six 500 kV substations, two 500 kV switching stations and one 345 kV substation. SGBH assumed responsibility for operating these 7 transmission companies. Then, in May 2012, SGBH entered into an agreement to acquire another seven Brazilian transmission concession companies, each with a secured 30-year operating right. The seven companies\\u2019 assets at the time of acquisition included transmission lines with a total length of 2,792 km, 11 self-owned substations and 12 substations jointly controlled with others.

The PBC loan covers 85% of the total project cost, and it carried an interest rate of 2%, a commitment fee of 0.2%, a management fee of 0.2%, a maturity of 15 years, and a grace period of 5 years.  The estimated total cost of the project is $174 million, and the remaining 15% of the project cost ($26.1 million) that was not covered by the China Eximbank loan was provided by the People's Bank, a state-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka. The contractor responsible for project implementation is Sinohydro Corporation Ltd.  As of March 31, 2018, funds had not yet been disbursed, but a pre-feasibility study had been completed and the PBC loan agreement had been approved.   The objective of the Thalpitigala Reservoir Project is to improve the agricultural productivity in the Badulla district by providing irrigation water while enhancing provision of safe drinking water and generation of hydropower. The scope of this project includes the provision of irrigation water to new and existing lands around 1400 hectares in the area through constructing upstream of the Battmedilla anicut in the Badulla district (within Uva Province), and the provision of safe drinking water facilities to Wasanagama, Madulla, Thetilla and Beramada villages in the Kandaketiya Divisonal Secretary's Division.   It also involves the construction of a hydropower station with a capacity of 15 MW that will generate 51 GWh of hydro power annually to fed the national grid. More specifically, this project will construct a concrete gravity dam in the mode of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) across Uma Oya, approximately 3 km upstream of the existing Bathmedilla Anicut (near the village Hunuketiya), to establish a 15.56 mcm capacity reservoir at full supply level of 454 m. The height of the proposed dam will be 45.7 m and it will result in the inundation of 96 ha of land confined mainly to the banks of the deep river valley.   The head works of the project include the dam, a spillway with seven radial gates (10m x 7.2m), water intake, headrace tunnel, surge shaft, penstock, power house and new access roads. In addition to the head works the project will also involve construction of structures such as camp sites, site offices, storage areas, vehicle parks etc which can use later for community purposes. The project commencement date was December 22, 2017.\",\"On May 29, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed a $157,001,049.89 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Supply of Rolling Stocks and Depot Equipment for Abuja Light Rail Project. The PBC (loan) carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The final maturity date of this loan is March 21, 2038. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria\\u2019s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank PBC (loan) had not yet disbursed and the borrower had not made any interest or principal repayments to the lender.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a commercial contract between the Government of Nigeria and China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC), which was signed on May 23, 2017. The purpose of the project is to facilitate the acquisition of 12 trains and 48 locomotives and rolling stock to support the Abuja Light Rail.   In 2012, China Eximbank also issued a $500 million loan for the construction of the Abuja Light Rail Network Project (as captured via Project ID#1851)\",\"On December 6, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Zimbabwe signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project. Then, on April 8, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Zimbabwe signed an RMB 1,045,139,500 ($153 million loan) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project. The Government of Zimbabwe on-lent the proceeds of the loan to the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ). The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity period, a 7 grace period, an interest rate of 2% per year, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The borrower is expected to deposit the proceeds from the Air Infrastructure Development Fund and passenger services charges at Harare International Airport into an escrow account with Stanbic (to facilitate the repayment of the loan and as a source of de facto collateral). The escrow account is jointly monitored by the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank.   As of August 2020, the loan had achieved a 85.7% disbursement rate ($131.2 million out of $153 million). Additional disbursements worth $27.8 million took place in 2022, bringing the loan disbursement rate to at least 100%. The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $81,231,518.01 as of 2021. The purpose of the project is to construct a new international terminal building at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport with a construction area of \\u200b\\u200b35,000 square meters, a new VIP building, and a satellite command center. It also involves maintenance on the existing 1.6 km runway, parking lot, and control tower, and the transformation of the existing terminal building and fire center. The project will also seek to increase the airport\\u2019s handling capacity from 2.5 million people per year to six million people per year. China Jiangsu International is the contractor responsible for project implementation.    On July 23, 2018, an official project commencement ceremony was held. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 36 months (July 23, 2021). However, this project has been plagued by scandal, controversy, and delay. In 2019, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe diverted $10 million from the project\\u2019s escrow account. China Eximbank then halted disbursements for the project and said that it would not release additional funds until the $10 million withdrawal was returned. It appears that this condition was eventually met because project implementation continued in 2020 and 2021. On February 26, 2020, Chinese Ambassador Guo Shaochun visited Zimbabwe to inspect the airport reconstruction. As of July 2020, the project achieved a 27% completion rate. China Eximbank also made a $27.7 million loan disbursement in 2020. Then, on September 1, 2021, President Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe visited the project site.    In mid-2022, the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance released a report, which provided evidence that the China Eximbank loan for the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project has financially underperformed. It noted that \\u2018[t]he low disbursements of loans is due to accumulation of arrears to active China Eximbank loans [\\u2026] on projects such as the Victoria Falls International Airport ($54 million), NetOne network expansion ($61 million) and expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport ($3 million).\\u2019 It also noted that, by the end of 2021, total external debt arrears to China Eximbank included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G. Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project, $0.5 million for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project, and $73 million for the Medical Equipment and Supplies Project.     As of August 2022, the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project had achieved a 67% completion rate and the Government of Zimbabwe had taken delivery 3 (out of 5) radars to support an air traffic control system. At that time, major outstanding works included refurbishment of the existing building and the procurement of required equipment.\",\"On March 21, 2011, the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank signed a $141.3 million buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement for Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project. Zimbabwean Vice President Joyce Mujuru signed the loan agreement in Harare. The loan agreement followed the signing of a 2010 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by the Chinese Government and Government of Zimbabwe for the financing of various development projects. Officials from Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance, representatives from China Eximbank and Sinosure signed the MOU. Sinosure agreed to provide insurance cover for various loans issued by China Eximbank. The BCL that was issued on March 21, 2011 carried the following borrowing terms: an 11 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 0.375% management fee, and a 0.375% commitment fee.    However, its face value was subsequently revised to $140,825,714.38. The purpose of this project was to support the development and rehabilitation of water works and sewers in the Zimbabwe\\u2019s capital, Harare. More specifically, the proceeds of the loan were to be used to rehabilitate, replace, install and commission equipment at the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant, the Prince Edward Water Treatment plant, the Crowborough sewage plant, the Firle sewage plant, and pump stations at Warren Control, Alex Park, and Letombo. Some of the loan proceeds were also earmarked for information technology and automated billing activities, the acquisition of water treatment chemicals, the installation of laboratory, the installation of pressure-reducing valves, and the installation of prepaid meters in 500,000 households.  China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation (CNMEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of the project.     This project officially entered into force on January 26, 2013, but it was plagued by various delays and controversies. In 2013, China Eximbank reportedly withheld loan disbursements due to the Government of Zimbabwe\\u2019s failure to meet its outstanding obligation under a 1997 loan that it provided to Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Industries (See Project ID#17125). In September 2013, 19 Chinese engineers joined a larger 46 engineer team to work on the project. Then, in June 2014, the deadline for project completion was pushed forward from April 2016 to June 2015. As of June 2014, several areas previously not receiving water had access and obsolete equipment was removed from facilities, the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant was operating at 70 percent capacity, and two pressure-reducing valves were installed at Warren Park D and Ardbennie.   A month later, in July 2014, an investigation was launched after the Harare City Council was accused of spending $8 million of the loan proceeds to purchase 25 luxury vehicles. Harare City Council insisted that the vehicles were for service deliveries; however, China Eximbank decided to withhold loan disbursements after learning that the loan proceeds were not being used for the intended purposes. As of June 2017, only half of the China Eximbank loan (approximately $72 million) had been disbursed. As of February 2020, China Eximbank was still withholding loan disbursements for this project. There is also evidence that the Government of Zimbabwe has fallen behind on its loan repayment schedule. As of 2018, the borrower had accumulated principal and interest arrears and penalties worth $28,430,361.10.   Also, according to a report released by the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance in mid-2022, the loan was still in arrears at the end of 2021. Total external debt arrears to China Eximbank at the end of 2021 included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G. Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project, $0.5 million for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project, and $73 million for the Medical Equipment and Supplies Project. The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $80,640,308.76 as of September 2021.\",\"In November 2021, Kalyon G\\u00fcne\\u015f Enerjisi \\u00dcretim A\\u015e. \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Kalyon \\u0130n\\u015faat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.\\u015e.  \\u2014 signed two loan agreements for the 1.35 GW Kalyon Karap\\u0131nar Solar Power Plant Project: a \\u00a3217 million ($288 million), 10-year buyer credit from JP Morgan with a full guarantee from UK Export Finance (UKEF), and a $523 million syndicated loan with a group of Chinese and non-Chinese banks that carries a 12-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 5.5% margin.

(TSKB), ICBC Turkey Yat\\u0131r\\u0131m Menkul De\\u011ferler, a subsidiary of ICBC Turkey Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Dubai (DIFC) Branch, and China Construction Bank.  The purpose of the project is to contribute to renewable and zero carbon supply of electricity to the national grid, contribute to Turkey\\u2019s energy transition, and help meet the increasing electricity demands throughout Turkey. The project scope involves the installation of a 1.35 GW solar power plant in Karap\\u0131nar district and Konya Province consisting of 3,376,890 photovoltaic (PV) panels with a gross capacity of approximately 1,000 MWac or 1,348 megawatts of DC power (MWdc), two substations (a 400kV substation at the north of the site and a 154kV substation at the south of the site), mounting and tracking structures, DC/AC current inverters, cabling, transformers, a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, and electrical transmission lines (ETLs)\\u2014a 154kV ETL and two 380kV ETLs, which are all under 5km in length\\u2014to connect the produced electricity to the national grid. The 19.2km2 project site lies in the Central Anatolia region, approximately 100km away from the Konya airport. The Karap\\u0131nar solar park will comprise up to 3.5 million ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) solar modules for a total net output of 1,000MW. The other main components in the project include mounting (tracking) structures, DC/AC inverters, cable networks, transformers, substations, energy transmission lines, and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. The project involves the construction of two electrical substations, one in the northern section and the other on the southern edge of the site. It will utilise 400kV, 154kV, and 33kV feeders along with IEC 61850-based substation automation system. The Karap\\u0131nar solar power project is planned to be developed in two phases, 200MW in phase one and 800MW in phase two. The other infrastructure facilities for the project include stormwater management, water supply, and drainage systems, apart from site fencing, a control building, a spare parts storage facility, and site access, and an internal road network.   The electricity generated by the Karap\\u0131nar solar power station will be evacuated to the national electricity grid through two separate connections. While a 400kV power transmission line will be connected to Ye\\u015filhisar Substation, another 154kV power evacuation line will be connected to the Karap\\u0131nar Substation for onward transmission into the grid. The project is part of the first solar tender launched by the Turkish Ministry of Energy under the Renewable Energy Resources Zones (YEKA) program in 2017, and hence a pathfinder for the sector. The deal was awarded to the lowest bid, with Kalyon offering $0.0699 per kWh and winning a 15-year PPA. The operating license for the project is 30 years.   Genel Elektrik Sistemleri (GES), Vekon, Chain Logistics, Nexten Enerji, RINA Company, UK Grid Solutions Ltd and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) are some of the contractors responsible for project implementation. Kalyon Enerji Group entered into a joint venture agreement with China Electronics Technology Corporation (CETC) for the development of the Karap\\u0131nar solar power plant along with a PV module manufacturing facility. Genel Elektrik Sistemleri (GES) was awarded a turnkey contract for the basic and detailed design, equipment supply, erection, testing, and commissioning of the 400kV and 154kV substations for the project in November 2019. Vekon started manufacturing and supplying the profile structures for the Karap\\u0131nar solar power project in July 2020, while Chain Logistics was contracted for the transportation of solar panels. Nexten Enerji was contracted for the construction and repair maintenance operations of the Karap\\u0131nar project, while Vigi Group was contracted by the Kalyon Enerji and CETC consortium for the project management services in September 2019. RINA Company was contracted for the preparation of the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) report for the project in 2020. RINA was also engaged to carry out the site survey and investigation in December 2017. UK Grid Solutions Ltd, owned by General Electric Company, is supplying inverter stations, tracker systems and other electrical supplies to the project. Technology is also being provided by China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC). Construction began on October 24, 2019. The Phase 1 production line was commissioned on August 19, 2020. The project was originally scheduled for full-scale commissioning in August 2023.\",\"On May 10, 2018, the Chinese Government and the Government of Ethiopia signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project. Then, on June 13, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599 or $156 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project (captured via Project ID#60762). On the same day, China\\u2019s Ministry of Commerce and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) interest-free loan agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project (captured via Project ID#66045). According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the GCL carries a 2% interest rate. However, the other borrowing terms of the GCL and the interest-free loan are unknown.  Ethiopia\\u2019s House of Representatives ratified both loan agreements on April 6, 2019. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the interest-free loan to finance a commercial contract with the Government of Ethiopia and China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC).   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP, two disbursements took place in 2020: an ETB 274,488,122 disbursement on April 2, 2020, and an ETB 682,257,203 disbursement on September 1, 2020. However, it is unclear if these disbursements took place through the RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599) China Eximbank loan, the RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) MOFCOM loan, or both loans.   This project involves the construction of the Gereb-Giba Dam on the Giba river and the installation of a water pipeline network to supply water to households, industrial parks and factories in and around the city of Mekelle (the capital of Ethiopia's northern Tigray regional state). Upon completion, the project is expected to meet the water needs of the estimated 400,000 residents of Mekelle. It is also expected to generate a maximum storage capacity of 363 million cubic meters during the rainy season, an annual water supply of 53.65 million cubic meters, and an average daily water supply of 124.43 thousand cubic meters. The project was also expected to create 1500 jobs for local people during the construction phase.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 22, 2019. Then, on March 17, 2020, a river closure ceremony took place and dozens of heavy trucks poured dirt and stone into the Giba river. The Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia, Mr. Tan Jian, and Mr. Debretsion, President of Tigray Regional State attended the closure ceremony, which marked the beginning of a new phase of the project (dam main body filling). Then, on November 11, 2020, after a violent conflict erupted between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Government of Ethiopia, the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia evacuated 600 Chinese workers (including CGGC workers assigned to the Mekelle City Water Supply Project) from Tigray State. The originally scheduled project completion date was March 1, 2023.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On February 20, 2020, PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel signed a $4.15 billion syndicated facility agreement with a group of Chinese and non-Chinese banks.

AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.

The purpose of the project is to construct a refinery in Pengerang within the state of Johor with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and produce Euro 5 gasoline and diesel, and other refined products, as well as feedstock for production of 3.3 million tons per annum (mtpa) of petrochemical products. To that end, the project involves development of a refinery complex, steam cracker and extraction complex, C2/C3 polymer complex and a C2 glycols petrochemical complex. The wider Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) scheme also involves separately funded projects, notably the Pengerang cogen project, an LNG regasification terminal, an air-separation unit, a raw water supply project, a liquid bulk terminal, and central and shared utilities and installations. Siemens AG, Siemens Malaysia, MMC Engineering, T\\u00e9cnicas Reunidas, Sinopec, JGC Corporation, Fluor Corporation of Texas, Italy's TechnipFMC, Mudajaya Group, VA Tech Wabag, Muhibbah Engineering and Wabag-Muhibbah JV, Axens, Bina Puri Holdings, DASCO, ATB Group, and Samsung Engineering are the contractors responsible for project design and implementation.  A feasibility study and a site topographical survey and soil investigation work for the project were completed in October 2011. Front-end engineering design (FEED) and environmental impact assessment studies were also completed. In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery\\u2019s diesel hydrotreating unit attained \\u2018Ready For Start Up (RFSU)\\u2019 status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery\\u2019s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia\\u2019s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.\",\"On May 7, 2001, China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) signed a supplier's credit agreement with the Government of Bangladesh for the Balancing, Modernisation, Rehabilitation and Expansion (BMRE) of the Karnaphuli Paper Mills in Chittagong. CMC, in turn, secured the funds for the supplier\\u2019s credit from an export seller\\u2019s credit from China Eximbank. The total value of the underlying commercial contract was $84 million, and China Eximbank agreed to finance approximately 85% of the commercial contract value, or $70.965 million. The supplier\\u2019s credit carried the following borrowing terms: a 16-year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and a 3.5% interest rate.    The purpose of the Karnaphuli Paper Mills BMRE Project was to expand the production capacity of Karnaphuli Paper Mills from 37500 metric tons to 85500 metric tons per year, and to improve the paper quality output of the mill. In 2005, the Chinese Government reportedly agreed to convert the supplier's credit into a concessional loan. However, after the BNP-Jamaat alliance government assumed office, they \\u2018shelved\\u2019 the project without explanation. The idea of the project resumed again in 2014, and the loan was reportedly converted into a zero-interest loan worth $87 million. However, according to the Government of Bangladesh\\u2019s Economic Relations Division (ERD), none of the committed funding had disbursed as of June 30, 2021. Nor had the borrower made any repayments as of June 30, 2021. As such, AidData assumes that the project never reached the implementation stage.\",\"On October 22, 2013, the City Legislature sanctioned Law No. 4,709 by which the capital investment for the acquisition of rolling stock for subway line A was declared of public interest and criticism, in order to ensure the correct provision of public service.

Then, on April 23, 2021, Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited signed a $184.3 million (BDT 16.14 billion) syndicated overseas loan agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and China CITIC Bank for the Joydevpur\\u2013Debogram\\u2013Bhulta\\u2013Madanpur Road Upgrading Project. On behalf of their respective loan syndicates, CDB and Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited signed a Common Terms Agreement. It is known that these loans carry 18-year maturities, but their interest rates and grace periods are unknown.   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) also issued a $100 million loan (ID#3958-BAN) on September 10, 2010 to Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited, which it appears to have on-lent to the Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited (before the syndicated loans were issued).   The total cost of the Joydevpur\\u2013Debogram\\u2013Bhulta\\u2013Madanpur Road Upgrading Project is $412.2275 million (RMB 2.844 billion). It is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited signed a concession agreement with Bangladesh's Roads and Highways Department (RHD) on December 6, 2018. This agreement made Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited responsible for designing, financing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the tolled expressway over a 25-year concession period, with tolls charged based on vehicle type. The Government of Bangladesh provided viability gap funding of BDT 3.1 billion and a minimum revenue guarantee to the concessionaire. The concession agreement also grants the Government of Bangladesh a share of the revenues generated by Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited over a certain threshold.  The purpose of the project is to upgrade the 48 km Joydevpur\\u2013Debogram\\u2013Bhulta\\u2013Madanpur Road to a dual carriageway to improve connectivity between country's north and northwest with Chattogram Port. More specifically, the project will seek to add a four-lane tollway and a two-lane service to the Joydevpur\\u2013Debogram\\u2013Bhulta\\u2013Madanpur Road (National Highway N105). The project\\u2019s ultimate aim is to create a key connection between the industrial zone northeast of Dhaka and national highway N1 to Chattogram, as well as to the N2, N3, and N4 national highways. Due to heavy traffic concerns, it is hoped that this project will reduce journey times and address traffic issues. Upon completion, the Joydevpur\\u2013Debogram\\u2013Bhulta\\u2013Madanpur Road will become Bangladesh's first toll road. Construction was originally expected to commence in September 2019.  A foundation stone laying ceremony took place on December 26, 2019, and at that time, the project was expected to reach completion in 2022. However, the project hit several snags. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to major implementation delays. A 2017 land acquisition law also increased the amount of financial compensation needed to pay affected people considerably, which led to land acquisition delays. Construction ultimately began in October 2020.

The total cost of the Duqm Refinery Construction Project is $8.28 billion and it is being financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 55:45.  The purpose of the project is to construct an oil refinery in the Duqm Special Economic Zone, which is strategically located outside the Straits of Hormuz to export refined products to Europe, Africa and the Far East. Duqm Refinery is actually located at three sites within (SEZAD), two at Duqm and one at Ras Markaz. The Duqm site will be the location of a complex refinery, on-site utilities, infrastructure, storage and a product export terminal located at the Port of Duqm. At Ras Markaz, a crude storage facility will be located at 80 kilometers from the refinery. Additionally, a pipeline will be constructed to transport crude oil from the crude storage facility to the refinery.  Spain's Tecnicas Reunidas Corporation and South Korea's Daewoo Engineering and Construction Corporation are the general contractors responsible for project implementation, but multiple companies are involved as subcontractors (including China National Chemical Engineering Third Construction Co. Ltd., which is also known as CNCEC). In August 2017, OOC and KPI awarded three EPC packages for Duqm: a $2.75 billion contract for the refinery's main process unit awarded to Spanish firm Tecnicas Reunidas in consortium with Daewoo Engineering & Construction of South Korea; a contract for the construction of utilities and offsite facilities awarded to a joint venture between UK's Petrofac and South Korea's Samsung Engineering, and a contract for the construction of a product storage and export terminal to Italy's Saipem International Samsung and Petrofac. In October 2018, a $50.6 million EPC sub-contract was awarded to Galfar Engineering and Contracting. CNCEC won an RMB 567 million (USD 80.58 million) EPC contract in August 2019. Site preparation was undertaken by Galfar Contracting Co. during 2015-2016.  Project implementation commenced in June 2018. As of December 2019, the project had achieved a 45% completion rate.

As of December 25, 2020, the project had achieved 93.7 million safe man-hours and was projected to reach completion in 2022. Upon completion, the refinery is expected to have capacity to process 230,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd). It is designed to process a range of blended crude oils. The refinery is configured as a full-conversion hydrocracker/coking facility. Moreover, the refinery is designed to have an operational life of at least 25 years and will produce diesel and jet/kerosene, meeting international specifications (Euro V and Jet A-1 respectively) as its primary products. The refinery will also produce naphtha and LPG. The products of the refinery will be sold to Oman Trading International Ltd (OTI) (50%) and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) (50%) under long term off-take agreements.

The members of the loan syndicate include China Eximbank (as the leading bank), Power China Finance Company Ltd. (as the co-leading bank), Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and the Beijing Branch of China Minsheng Bank Corp Ltd. The $1,026,000,000 project is being implemented on an Independent Power Project (IPP) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 85:15 (with Iraqi KAR Power Company providing the equity contribution). The interest rate of the loan is unknown. However, it is known that the loan carried a 14.5 year (174-month) maturity length. The Iraqi Government issued a sovereign guarantee for deferred payment to Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. (Sinohydro) under its EPC contract with KAR Electrical Power Production Trading FZE, while Sinosure provided medium and long term export seller\\u2019s credit insurance to Sinohydro and Sinohydro provided a credit guarantee for 10% of the financing. China Eximbank also provided financing for 100% of the amount of account receivables of Sinohydro under its EPC contract without recourse. The project\\u2019s recourse structure is designed so that during the construction period Sinohydro is liable to pay the syndicate of Chinese banks in the event of default and Sinosure refuses to provide indemnity.    Later, during the power plant\\u2019s operation period, KAR Electrical Power Production Trading FZE will be responsible for repayment of the syndicated loan, and if it fails to do so, the Chinese banks will be repaid by the Iraqi Government (due to the sovereign guarantee) or via indemnity from Sinosure. The purpose of the project is to convert the Al-Rumaila Power Plant, in Basra Governorate, Iraq, from a simple cycle plant to a combined cycle plant by installing up to 730MW of steam turbines and all other necessary equipment. The wider purpose of the project is to alleviate power shortages in Iraq following conflict there. The first phase of the project is to expand the power plant's existing 5 \\u00d7 293MW simple cycle gas-fired unit into a combined cycle unit. The combined cycle unit consists of 2 gas turbines + 2 waste heat boilers + 1 turbo-generator set, and 3 gas turbines + 3 waste heat boilers + 1 turbo-generator set. Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. (Sinohydro), a subsidiary of Power Construction Corporation of China (POWERCHINA), is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. It signed a deferred payment EPC contract with KAR Electrical Power Production Trading FZE. RAZ Company for Construction & Engineering is also involved as a sub-contractor.

The purpose of the project is to reconstruct the Wyndham Luxury resort at the Sam Lord's Castle in Saint Phillip's Parish (in Chinese: \\u5c71\\u59c6\\u7f57\\u5fb7\\u9152\\u5e97). The resort was expected to add 450 rooms to the island's room stock and to employ over 1,000 people.   China National Complete Plant Import & Export Corporation is the contractor responsible for project implementation.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 23, 2015. However, construction did not begin until June 2016. The project was originally expected to take three years to complete. However, project implementation \\u2018stalled\\u2019 in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic led to additional implementation delays in 2020. In July 2021, COMPLANT brought close to 200 Chinese workers to the project site.  However, local contractors expressed concern, pointing out that Barbadian companies were being pushed out in favor of the lower-wage Chinese laborers. One local contractor claimed that COMPLANT was constantly trying to get them to reduce their rates to levels which were not sustainable. The same contractor complained about a shortage of bathroom facilities on the job site \\u2014 for both the local and Chinese workers. At the time, Stuart Layne, CEO of the Barbados Tourism Investment Inc., said they were still maintaining the 60/40 agreement ratio, with local contractors getting 40 percent of the work at the project site.  On June 1, 2018, the Government of Barbados announced a selective default and requested IMF balance of payments support. The timing of the announcement was partly driven by large external debt payments that were due in early June 2018, and the Government of Barbados defaulted on these partly with the aim of preserving foreign exchange reserves. However, the Government of Barbados honored its repayment obligations to China Eximbank under the PBC for the Sam Lord's Castle Hotel Reconstruction Project. As of 2020, Government of Barbados was unable to meet its $30 million counterpart funding contribution to the $200 million project and actively seeking to sell the hotel asset (upon completion of its construction). A Request for Proposals (RFP) for the sale of the property closed at the end of January 2020 and officials from the Government of Barbados subsequently conducted a review to select a suitable buyer. \",\"On August 21, 2014, the China Development Bank and the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) \\u2014 a state-owned bank in Mongolia \\u2014 signed a loan agreement worth $162 million (or MNT 316,418.8 million).

This issue requires further investigation.\",\"On March 3, 2016, China Railway Seventh Group (a subsidiary of China Railway Engineering Corporation) provided a $165 million supplier credit to a project company (known as the Wellington-Masiaka Toll Road PPP) for the 67 km Wellington-Masiaka Toll Highway Project. This loan reportedly has a 27 maturity and a 4 year grace period. It will be repaid by charging motorists using the Wellington-Masiaka motorway at three toll stations (Jui, Mile 38, and Masiaka).   The 62 km Wellington-Masiaka Toll Highway Project involves the upgrading of a 62 km road from Wellington (Yonibana) to Masiaka to a four-lane dual carriageway. It is being undertaken as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) between the Government of Sierra Leone and the Chinese Railway Seventh Group under a 25 year build, own, operate and transfer (BOOT) agreement (extended to 27 years later in 2017). The project officially commenced on April 25, 2016. On June 4, 2020 members of the Ministry of Works and Public Assets (MWPA) and Sierra Leone Roads Authority (SLRA) toured the Wellington-Masiaka Road Construction site. They noted COVID-19 as a major hinderance to the projects progression, as the project would have been completed in April 2020. As of June 4, 2020, the project is 70% completed.   After completing the first phase of the construction of the project during the second quarter of 2017, China Railway Seventh Group started trial operations in August 2017. It also began collecting tolls in 2017. Then, in 2018, the Sierra Leone Road Transport Authority announced a technical and financial audit into the project and Parliament referred the report to the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) to take action.  In 2018, the Chinese government exempted all the interest-free loans borrowed by the Sierra Leonean government and offered to suspend 2020 debt repayments. \",\"On November 12, 2019, Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) \\u2014 a state-owned enterprise and the world's second largest cocoa producer \\u2014 signed a $600 million receivables-backed term loan facility agreement with the African Development Bank, Credit Suisse AG, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).   Then, in February 2020, several other development finance institutions (DFIs) joined the loan syndicate, including the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the Development Bank of South Africa, and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Spa, an Italian development bank. The development institutions reportedly contributed to a $250 million, 7-year loan tranche, while the commercial banks (ICBC and Credit Suisse) contributed to a $350 million, 5-year loan tranche. The interest rates that applied to these loan tranches are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) receivables from future cocoa sales contracts.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance key components of its Productivity Enhancement Programmes (\\u201cPEPs\\u201d). The objective of the PEPs is to roll out a set of measures that will improve productivity per hectare and increase cocoa production levels well above 1 million tonnes per year (versus an average of 800,000 tonnes per year over the last ten years). The PEPs were expected to mainly entail measures to sustainably increase plant fertility; develop irrigation systems; rehabilitate aged and disease-infected farms; increase warehouse capacity; and create an integrated farmer database. The programs were also expected to provide short-term working capital support to local cocoa-processing companies, thus facilitating domestic value addition) and consumption of cocoa products in Ghana.   One source indicates that the loan proceeds were earmarked for the following purposes: $140 million for fighting Cocoa Swollen Shoot Virus Disease (CSSVD), $50 million for investing in COCOBOD's warehousing facilities, $200 million for processing cocoa locally and meeting the Government of Ghana's goal of processing 50% of the nations cocoa locally by 2022, $7.5 million for building a domestic consumer base, and $10.6 million for establishing a database of all cocoa farmers in the country.\",\"On May 12, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $171,080,400 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. 2017 (15) TOTAL NO. (441)] for the Arsi Negele Hawassa Section (Lot 4) of the Modjo Hawassa Highway Construction Project. The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the loan agreement on July 5, 2017 under Proclamation No.1043/2017. The proclamation entered into force on September 8, 2017. The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance a $196 million commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) and China Railway Seventh Group Co. Ltd (CRSG).   According to official correspondence between the Concessional Loan Department of China Eximbank and the State Minister of Finance of Ethiopia (on December 25, 2019), China Eximbank made an initial loan disbursement worth $37,015,814.73 (as part of an advance payment and progress payment) on December 25, 2019. This overall loan disbursement rate was of December 25, 2019 was 21.6%. As of April 2022, no additional loan disbursements were recorded in the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP).   The purpose of the $700 million Modjo-Hawassa Highway Construction Project is to construct a 203 km expressway between the cities of Mojo and Hawassa with two carriageways, each with two 3.65-meter-wide lanes and paved outer and inner shoulders, grade separated junctions, a 9-meter wide median, and 31 local crossings for animals and pedestrians. The project is specifically tied to an effort to develop a flagship industrial park in the city of Hawassa called the Hawassa Industrial Park (HIP).   The Modjo Hawassa Highway Construction Project is being financed and implemented in 4 lots. Lot 1 is a 57 km Modjo-Meki section of the highway that is being financed by the African Development Bank and the Government of Ethiopia (and implemented by CREC). Lot 2 is a 37 km Meki-Batu Ziway section of the highway that is being financed by Korea Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia. Lot 3 is a 55 km Batu Ziway-Arsi Negele section of the highway that is being financed by the World Bank. Lot 4 is a 51.68 km Arsi Negele-Hawassa section of the highway being financed by China Eximbank.   CRSG is the EPC contractor responsible for Lot 4 implementation. Lots 1 and 2 were inaugurated in May 2021. However, the infrastructure for toll services remained unfinished as of late 2021. Lot 4 entered implementation in 2017. However, as of October 2019, it had only achieved a 4% completion rate. Lot 4 encountered major implementation problems and delays. China Eximbank withheld loan disbursements and halted project implementation in August 2021. However, in the absence of China Eximbank financing, the Ethiopian Government reportedly continued to finance the implementation of Lot 4.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Arsi Negele-Hawassa Section of the Modjo Hawassa Highway Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects (including the Arsi Negele-Hawassa Section of the Modjo Hawassa Highway Construction Project) and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"In 2017, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.  and the Government of Kenya\\u2019s Ministry of Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) proposed the Konza Data Centre and and Smart City Project as part of a larger Konza Technology City (also called Konza Technopolis) initiative. Konza Technology City was first proposed in in 2008 as part of a Kenya Vision 2030 and began construction in 2013. Then, on April 26, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya's Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1,225,000,000 (Ksh 17 billion) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Konza Data Centre and and Smart City Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 19.5 year maturity (final maturity date: September 21, 2038), a 7-year grace period (first repayment date: March 31, 2026), a 2% interest rate, and a 0.5% commitment fee. The proceeds of the loan are to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, which was signed on June 22, 2017.   The lender made disbursements worth RMB 90,653,760.44 between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 (Fiscal Year 2019-2020), RMB 131,870,086.70 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 247,718,790.85 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).

The purpose of the project is to construct a National Cloud Data Center, Smart ICT Network, Public Safe City and Smart Traffic Solutions, and a Government Cloud and Enterprise Service. The project site is located approximately 61 km from Nairobi, 51 km from Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA), and 400 km from Mombasa.   Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.  According to the Government of Kenya's Electronic Project Management Information System (e-ProMIS), the project had a planned starting date of October 1, 2019 and a planned end date of June 30, 2022. However, it has faced a number of implementation delays. As of December 2018, Reuters reported the Konza Technology City had still no completed the construction of the first building. However, as of March 2019, construction of the first building was reportedly 90% complete. Then, on July 23, 2020, Phase I of Konza Technopolis Data Center was completed, and Kenya government ministries and other agencies announced that they would migrate their data, whose services will also be available for private entities as part of a commercialization plan. The project is currently focusing on the development of infrastructure, which is approximately 50% complete and is expected to be finalized by December 2021. Progress has been made on the construction of roads, a utility corridor, and the installation of a water reclamation system.\",\"On November 27, 2012, the Chinese Government and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement regarding a preferential credit line for infrastructure and technology projects. Then, on October 25, 2013, China Eximbank and the Public Enterprise for State Roads of the Republic of Macedonia signed a $505,044,966.98 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Kicevo-Ohrid Motorway Construction Project (captured via Project ID#66444). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The PBC was to be repaid in thirty semi-annual installments. On January 9, 2014, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the PBC. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 90% of the $555,549,463.68 cost of a commercial contract [ID#29-01-135] that it signed with Sinohydro Corporation Limited on June 5, 2012. The remaining 10% was provided by the Public Enterprise for State Roads. The 2013 PBC\\u2019s outstanding (principal) amount as of December 31, 2019 was $324,442,683.   The purpose of this project was to construct a 57-km long and 25.2-meter wide highway \\u2014 with 6 overpasses, 13 underpasses, and a 2 km long tunnel named 'Preseka' \\u2014 between the city of Kicevo and the city of Ohrid. The highway will pass through Kicevo, Podvis, Preseka, Pesocani, Trebenista, Podmolje, and Ohrid. Sinohydro Bureau 7. Co.

A groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 22, 2014 and the project was originally expected to reach completion on June 30, 2021. However, the project has encountered various delays and cost overruns. Some of these were due to poor geological surveys. Additionally, no intersections were part of the original road plan, which made it impossible to access the highway from villages along its route.   To address these cost overruns, China Eximbank and the Public Enterprise for State Roads of the Republic of Macedonia signed an additional PBC agreement worth $179,694,572.51 for the Kicevo-Ohrid Motorway Construction Project in 2019 (captured via Project ID#85195). It carried the same borrowing terms as the PBC that was signed on October 25, 2013: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and and a 0.25% management fee. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of this PBC on November 21, 2019.   On March 26, 2015, Macedonian opposition leader Zoran Zaev released audio recordings related to the construction of the highways. The recordings provided evidence that the tender process had not been transparent, and only two companies had been approved by the Chinese Embassy in Skopje: CWE and Sinohydro Corporation Limited. Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was accused of disregarding CWE's lower bid and taking a bribe from Sinohydro Corporation Limited that amounted to 5% of the value of the commercial contract (approximately EUR 20,000,000). The EU intervened and made a deal in which a special prosecutor was appointed, and the Prime Minister stepped down. The special prosecutor charged the former Prime Minister in Charge of Economic Affairs, the former Minister of Transport, and the former Head of the Public Enterprise for National Roads with \\u2018Abuse of Official Position and Authorization\\u2019 on June 29, 2017. Former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was charged with \\u2018Accepting a Reward for Unlawful Influence\\u2019; he fled and received political asylum in Hungary. By 2019, the Special Prosecutor was also charged with corruption, the statute of limitations had expired, and no one was found guilty. In May of 2019, evidence was presented by newly appointed Director of Public Enterprise for State Roads that Sinohydro had only built 2.7 km of the highways, and had instead relied on subcontractors. Sinohydro Corporation Limited then marked up the subcontractor's invoices by 54% when it presented its invoices to the Public Enterprise for State Roads. Some of the items in the original bid had been marked up by as much as 300%. In 2019, Sinohydro Corporation Limited went through a more transparent tender process to build the Krupishte-Kocani highway, and the price per cubic meter was four times lower.\",\"According to the Government of Cambodia\\u2019s ODA database, China Eximbank and the Government of Cambodia signed a RMB 1,246,966,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement on November 28, 2019 for the Construction of National Road from Samlot-Veal Veng-Koh Kong (NR. 1551) Project.

On the same day, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda signed an RMB 1,260,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 6 TOTAL NO. (545)] for Phase 1 of the Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project.  Uganda\\u2019s Parliament then ratified the loan agreement on July 29, 2015. Several months later, on November 17, 2015, the Government of Uganda entered into a subsidiary, on-lending agreement with Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA). The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% (RMB 3,150,000) management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The first scheduled loan repayment date is April 1, 2022.   The GCL is secured by (collateralized against) airport revenues deposited in a lender-controlled bank account with a minimum cash balance requirement. A December 3, 2015 escrow account agreement between the Government of Uganda's Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development, Stanbic Bank Uganda Limited, UCAA, and China Eximbank specifies that the borrower must maintain a minimum cash balance in the repayment reserve account of RMB 25,200,000 during the loan\\u2019s grace period (equivalent to total payable interest for one year during the loan\\u2019s grace period) and RMB 98,870,000 during the loan\\u2019s repayment period (equivalent to total payable principal and interest for one year during the loan\\u2019s repayment period). The GCL agreement also specifies that the 'all the revenues (proceeds) of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) shall be applied in priority to payment of any and all amounts due and payable [to the lender].' Under the terms of an Escrow Account Agreement, UCAA also agreed to (a) seek secure advance approval from China Eximbank for any use of the airport revenues that it deposits in the escrow account; and (b) grant China Eximbank approval authority over the airport\\u2019s annual budgets.   The ultimate borrower/end-user (UCAA) is expected to use the GCL proceeds to finance a $200,000,000 commercial (EPC) contract between UCAA and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed on October 8, 2014 and amended on January 12, 2015.   According to the Government of Uganda\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 78% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 26 loan disbursements (worth $156,639,169.44) between 2015 and 2021: a $60,124,334.71 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $9,822,292.39 disbursement on November 15, 2016, a $4,473,339.53 disbursement on December 14, 2016, a $5,272,753.02 disbursement on March 29, 2017, a $2,363,019.84 disbursement on April 20, 2017, a $1,336,370.91 disbursement on May 25, 2017, a $1,237,900.78 disbursement on August 10, 2017, a $5,492,164.36 disbursement on November 21, 2017, a $3,445,536.22 disbursement on December 27, 2017, a $21,668,252.97 disbursement on April 19, 2019, a $3,032,693.76 disbursement on May 30, 2019, a $3,743,156.53 disbursement on August 22, 2019, a $3,074,851.76 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a $2,911,749.34 disbursement on November 25, 2019, a $2,683,403.29 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a $1,275,590.33 disbursement on April 27, 2020, a $3,197,241.55 disbursement on May 27, 2020, a $1,758,890.15 disbursement on July 24, 2020, a $1,831,735.75 disbursement on August 7, 2020, a $1,944,401.91 disbursement on September 28, 2020, a $3,835,965.97 disbursement on December 18, 2020, a $4,414,162.60 disbursement on November 24, 2021, a $3,128,465.91 disbursement on March 30, 2022, a $2,110,577.92 disbursement on August 17, 2022, a $1,314,054.62 disbursement on November 17, 2022, and a $1,146,263.31 disbursement on December 13, 2022.  According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $155,982,698.23 and the loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $155,982,698.23.   The purpose of the project\\u2019s first phase is to upgrade and expand Entebbe International Airport. The airport is located at 5 minutes from the main campus of Kampala International University, near the town of Entebbe, on the shores of Lake Victoria, and approximately 40.5 kilometers (25 mi) by road south-west of the central business district of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. Its exact locational coordinates are 00\\u00b002\\u203241\\u2033N 032\\u00b026\\u203235\\u2033E\\u201d. Phase 1 activities include constructing a new cargo terminal, resurfacing the main runway with new lighting, constructing a new terminal building (that is adjacent and connected to the existing terminal and with aerobridges), repairing, strengthening and expanding the main apron serving the existing terminal and the new terminal, repairing the second runway and associated taxiways, repairing Apron 2 (which serves VVIPs or Very Very Important Persons), strengthening Apron 4 (which serves general aviation and cargo aircraft), replacing aging navigation aids, and constructing a multi-story car park. The total cost of Phase 1 is $200 million and the total cost of Phase 2 is $125 million. These two phases were originally expected to take 5 years to implement. It is expected that, upon completion, the expanded and upgraded airport will increase annual passenger output at the airport from 1.5 million to 3.5 million and freight volume of the completed freight center from 55,000 tons to 100,000 tons CCCC is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Dar Al-Handasah (Shair & Partners) is responsible for project supervision. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 29, 2015. Construction began on May 10, 2016. As of June 2019, the project had achieved a 52% completion rate. As of October 26, 2021, the Government of Uganda\\u2019s Aid Management Platform summarized the status of the project in the following manner: \\u2018Physical Progress: The overall performance of the civil works currently stands at 50%. One runway is complete; works on the runway apron are halfway and 80% of the works on the cargo building have been achieved. Challenges: Overdue IPC Payments which have led to accrual of interest charges e.g accrued interest for [Interim Payment Certificate]# 1 up to [Interim Payment Certificate] #23 as of July 11th 2019 stood at USD 951,368.49. This increases by the month. Progress of the Cargo Terminal and Airfield Works continues but require intense supervision to ensure acceptable workmanship and approved materials are employed. Some [overdue] approved materials for the Cargo Complex are not yet delivered to [the project site], meaning that delays encountered so far will not be recovered. The project still reports approximately Eleven Months delay and the Contractor [CCCC] is still reluctant to [reprogram its] work in accordance with Clause 8.3 of the General Conditions of Contract, to include measures intended to recover lost time. It is also evident that project completion cannot be achieved by May 2021. In addition, challenges for construction include coordination difficulties with the extensive fuel network (by Tristar) and with Airport Operations, Safety and Security, due to the naturally intrusive nature of construction within an operational environment. Runway 17/35 and Apron 1 Works are particularly noted in this respect.  By November 2021, the project had achieved an overall completion rate or 75.1%. Then, in March 2022, construction of the cargo terminal was completed. Li Qinpu, a project manager of the CCCC, said at the peak of the construction of the cargo terminal, the project employed 80 Chinese workers and more than 900 local workers at different skills levels. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by May 9, 2021. However, this date was subsequently pushed out to December 5, 2022. The expected completion date of the project\\u2019s second phase (which had not yet secured financing as of March 2022) is March 2024. The Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project has become a source of local and international controversy. One set of concerns relate to the potentially inflated cost of the underlying commercial contract. CCCC (the EPC contractor) pre-financed the feasibility study for the design and implementation of project. The feasibility study report submitted to CAA in December 2013 costed Phase 1 of the project at $200,000,000, which paved the way for the signing of a $200,000,000 commercial contract between CAA and CCCC on October 2014. There was, however, no independent review of the feasibility estimates by UCAA during the procurement stage which would have informed the Government of Uganda on the reasonableness and accuracy of the cost estimates prior to agreeing to CCCC securing the funds from China Eximbank.   Additionally, the UCAA contracts committee approved the project cost in the feasibility study on September 23, 2014 without undertaking an independent evaluation of these costs. Another set of concerns relate to the collateralization arrangement that underpins the China Eximbank loan agreement and an Escrow Account Agreement in which UCAA reportedly granted China Eximbank approval authority over the Entebbe International Airport\\u2019s annual budgets and UCAA\\u2019s use of revenues from the airport in the escrow account. The loan agreement states that repayment of the China Eximbank loan is the responsibility of the \\u201cend user\\u201d (CAA) and the escrow account (established as a requirement of the loan agreement to facilitate repayment) should be funded using airport revenues. However, in January 2019, Uganda\\u2019s Auditor General revealed that the Government of Uganda\\u2019s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development had made interest payments on the loan and but not deposited airport revenues in the escrow account. The Auditor General also noted that \\u201cinconsistencies in the operationalization of the agreements and the involved parties\\u2019 deemed actions represent non-compliance/ breach of contract that could result in penalties and even cancellation of the [loan] facility.\\u201d By March 2019, China Eximbank responded to the borrower\\u2019s non-compliance with escrow account conditions by halting loan disbursements, which in turn led to the Government of Uganda falling behind on payments to CCCC (the EPC contractor). This resulted in major construction delays. CCCC\\u2019s payment certificates 11-23 (worth $24.5 million) for work performed between December 2017 and February 2019 were not paid, which led to a project implementation standstill that lasted for 361 days. UCAA later told a parliamentary oversight body that \\u201c[t]hese [escrow account] conditions were not palatable for an international airport of a sovereign state whose operations are dynamic and sometimes unpredictable.\\u201d The Government of Uganda responded on March 6, 2019 by dispatching an 11-member delegation (consisting of CAA officials, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development officials, the Deputy Solicitor General, and Uganda\\u2019s Ambassador to China, H.E. Dr. Crispus C.W. Kiyonga) to Beijing to renegotiate so-called \\u2018toxic clauses\\u2019 in the loan agreement with China Eximbank. According to an internal Government of Uganda record (a September 5, 2019 memo/letter from Finance Minister Matia Kasaija to Public Works Minister Monica Azuba Ntege), \\u201c[w]hile the initial agenda was to cause a re-negotiation of specific clauses in the original financing agreement that seemed very unsuitable to [the Government of Uganda] and therefore to the end user (UCAA), the [China Eximbank] officials made it clear from the onset that re-negotiation and amendment of the loan agreement were not agreeable to them. The Bank proposed, which the [Government of Uganda delegation] found plausible, that rather than having a re-negotiation, we could have a \\u2018clarification\\u2019 of the contentious clauses with a view of having a workable interpretation. It was the understanding of all parties that to achieve a win-win situation, the contentious clauses would be interpreted with a view of having a balanced effect that would enable resumption of disbursement without necessarily amending the agreement. The Bank\\u2019s view was that such an amendment if allowed would set a bad precedent and more so, they saw no cause to warrant the amendment.   In that regard, it was agreed that: i) The Bank resumes financing through disbursements and makes flexible the conditions set around the Escrow Account Agreement clauses especially the provision requiring UCAA to deposit all airport revenues [in] this account. The Bank clarified that the objective of the sales collection account was to see [UCAA\\u2019s] inflows and outflows for this account and that since the minimum reserve amount was already available on the debt reserve payment account, the funds would henceforth be available for [UCAA\\u2019s] operations. It was agreed that the Borrower [the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development] shares proof of the banking on the sales collection account as a trigger for the Bank to unlock disbursements. This has since been implemented. ii) Another contentious matter that the delegation wanted to be varied was the provision requiring UCAA to submit for approval all their operational budgets to [China Eximbank]. The Bank clarified that they were interested in the project budget but since this budget was subsumed in other UCAA operational activities, UCAA was henceforth required to share approved budgets with the Bank for review only and not for approval.\\u201d China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda delegation also reportedly agreed to keep the details of their meeting (\\u2018minutes of the meeting\\u2019) confidential. Then, on December 20, 2019, Uganda\\u2019s Office of the Auditor General publish a report that criticized Uganda\\u2019s Ministry of Finance for the borrowing terms in the Entebbe airport loan agreement and several other loan agreements with China Eximbank: \\u201cA review of the various facility agreements for issued [China Eximbank] loans revealed that the [Government of Uganda] was obliged to open escrow accounts where the government was expected to make advance deposit of funds over the tenure of the loan required for the repayment of the loan. It was observed that some of the escrow bank accounts are held with local commercial banks while others are held in the Lenders countries. [\\u2026] The funds are deposited on commercial bank accounts upfront and the creditors have access to them before even the loans are disbursed. Government of Uganda has no control over these accounts. The practice causes financial strain to the cash flows of the country and maybe as a result of weaknesses in negotiations that are undertaken by the government of Uganda and the lenders. These funds could have been used as advance to start the implementation of the projects for which the financing is required. The practice distorts the Government [of Uganda]s] cash flows and monetary control policy. The [Government of Uganda\\u2019s] Accounting Officer promised to improve on the way [the Government] negotiate[s] loans with escrow conditionalities. [Uganda\\u2019s Auditor General] advised the Accounting [Officer] to in future avoid loans with such unfavourable terms or negotiate to have such terms softened.\\u201d   Then, in October 2021, a parliamentary panel led by opposition politicians revealed that the Government of Uganda\\u2019s arrangement with China Eximbank requires that all of UCAA\\u2019s revenues and expenditures pass through accounts controlled by China Eximbank at a Kampala branch of South Africa\\u2019s Standard Bank Group Ltd. (Stanbic Bank), which is itself partly owned by Beijing\\u2019s biggest state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Members of Parliament\\u2019s Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprise (Cosase) raised questions and concerns about the wisdom of granting financial oversight power (and influence over which creditors get paid first) \\u2014 normally reserved for the country\\u2019s treasury and parliament \\u2014 to a Chinese state-owned bank. They also questioned the wisdom of the Ugandan Government limiting its own ability to tap into revenue from rapidly expanding tourism and exports. [Note: Entebbe International Airport is a regional hub airport. Traffic has soared over the past decade and is expected to grow more amid a $15 billion crude-oil development project along Uganda\\u2019s border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.] Joel Ssenyonyi, a member of parliament who led the panel, said \\u201cIt\\u2019s appalling. [\\u2026] that [China Eximbank] now has to approve any budget spending [of UCAA].\\u201d On October 28, 2021, Uganda's Finance Minister Matia Kasaija was called before the parliamentary panel and questioned over the terms of the loan. He apologized to the lawmakers, noting that \\u201cwe shouldn\\u2019t have accepted some of the clauses. [...] But they told you . . . either you take it or leave it.\\u201d He also said the loan would be repaid and there was no chance that the airport would be seized by the lender. Then, on November 25, 2021, a local newspaper in Uganda (The Daily Monitor) published a report, which suggested that the China Eximbank loan agreement \\u201cif not amended, [could] expose Uganda's sovereign assets to attachments and take-over upon arbitration awards in Beijing.\\u201d Two days later, on November 27, 2021, UCAA Spokesperson Vianney M Luggya tweeted that \\u201cIt is true that @UgandaCAA opened up a Sales Collection Account in @stanbicug where all the [UCAA\\u2019s] revenues are deposited in line with the Escrow Account Agreement terms, but it does not mean that anyone is to control our finances.\\u201d Luggya also tweeted that \\u201cThe [UCAA] enjoys the freedom & liberty of spending what is collected (as per the budget). The lender\\u2019s monitoring of the account is only similar to what happens when one gets a salary loan or any other loan, & the bank requests that the salary is channeled through their bank. It does not mean that lending bank takes over your salary.\\u201d In late 2021, internal disagreements within the executive branch of the Ugandan Government also spilled into public view. Uganda's Finance Minister Matia Kasaija reportedly advocated for adherence to the agreement that the Government of Uganda struck with China Eximbank in March 2019 (as codified in the \\u2018minutes of the meeting\\u2019). However, UCAA and the Ministry of Public Works reportedly treated Kasaija\\u2019s position \\u2018with disdain for allegedly blind-spotting a deal that presents real risks to Uganda's sovereign assets.\\u2019 UCAA officials reportedly flagged up to 13 clauses in the China Eximbank agreement as \\\"unfair\\u201d or a threat to \\u201cthe sovereignty of Uganda.\\u201d A confidential source told the a local newspaper in Uganda that \\u201cit\\u2019s clear that [U]CAA will lose its rights of use and control over its revenues [\\u2026] as a self-financing institution with limited funding. Such provisions would expose the [organization] to risk of failure in service delivery and bankruptcy.\\u201d In June 2020, David Kakuba, who was the Director General of UCAA at that time, warned that granting China Eximbank approval authority over UCAA\\u2019s budgeting and planning decisions \\u201cexposes UCAA to risk of failure to deliver its mandate, and infringes on State's effective control over UCAA.\\u201d After Kakuba\\u2019s retirement, the Acting UCAA Director General Fred Bamwesigye wrote to Works Minister Gen Edward Katumba Wamala on September 8, 2021 and reminded him of the importance of renegotiating the loan agreement with China Eximbank. He also asked him to remind Minister of Finance Matia Kasaija to notify China Eximbank of the need to amend the agreement to make it consistent with Ugandan law and international law. He wrote that \\u201cwhereas some of the provisions referred to were alluded to in the Minutes of the Negotiations, the unfair clauses remain embedded in the agreements, while in some cases, they were not dealt with at all. [\\u2026] There is, therefore, an urgent need to start the review and renegotiation of the Government Concession Loan Agreement... in order to reduce the intentions of the parties into a legally-binding agreement.\\u201d Then, on December 11, 2019, David Kakuba warned Minister of Finance Matia Kasaija that \\u201cany seeming delay or any form of understanding that is not reduced into an amended agreement of the signed ones, would maintain the enforceability by [China Eximbank] of the disputed agreement.\\u201d He also noted that Section 10.3 of the Repayment Mechanism Agreement provides for a waiver of immunity and states that \\u2018each obligor hereby irrevocably waives any immunity on grounds of sovereign or other immunity for itself or any of its property in connection with any arbitration proceeding or with enforcement of any arbitral awards any court judgement.' Such a provision, if not amended, David Kakuba argues \\\"exposes government assets to attachments and take-over upon arbitration awards in China.\\u201d Around the same time, Uganda\\u2019s Ministry of Public Works reportedly asked the Ministry of Finance to seek a speedy revision and resolution of the \\u2018problematic clauses\\u2019 in the China Eximbank loan agreement. However, in December 2021, Bloomberg reported that \\u201cUganda\\u2019s chief legal officer urged the Finance Ministry to refrain from renegotiating the terms of [the China Eximbank loan agreement] as it is able to meet its debt obligations.\\u201d\",\"On November 27, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Suriname signed an RMB 1.4 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2019) 16 TOTAL NO (687)] for the J.A. Pengel International Airport Expansion Project. The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a commitment fee of 0.25%, and a management fee of 0.25%. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $199 million USD commercial contract with China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC).   The purpose of the project is to construct a new terminal at J.A. Pengel International Airport (exact locational coordinates: 5.4527, -55.1873) that connects the arrival and departure facilities, and doubling the current airport size.   CHEC is the contractor responsible for implementation. In February 2021, the Suriname Ministry of Public Works announced that the project was halted for the time being and under evaluation. No other reasons were were provided about the halting of the project.  However, there are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the .A. Pengel International Airport Expansion Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. The Government of Suriname defaulted on its sovereign debt obligations three times during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2021, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that \\u2018Suriname owes arrears to China and India, which have provided assurances, although less specific than those provided by the Paris Club creditors, that they intend to work with Suriname towards a debt restructuring that will restore sustainability. China has consented to [IMF] financing notwithstanding these arrears. [...] An update will be circulated to the [IMF] Executive Board not later than one week prior to the scheduled Board consideration. On the basis of the Surinamese authorities\\u2019 commitment noted above, staff expect that debt to China and India will be treated on comparable terms with other bilateral creditors. The arrears constitute a form of financing contribution to the program. China and India have acknowledged that Suriname will continue to run arrears on their official debt until a debt treatment can be agreed.\\u2019 The IMF also disclosed in December 2021 that \\u2018[t]he stock of external arrears is estimated to be at 11 percent of GDP by end-2021, including arrears of USD 61 million to China.\\u2019 Then, in May 2023, the IMF announced the \\u2018[a]n agreement was reached with Paris Club (PC) creditors for a two-step debt treatment in June 2022, and bilateral agreements with most of the PC creditors have been completed. An agreement-in-principle with bondholders was reached on May 4, 2023. The authorities are actively negotiating in good faith with China and India on a debt restructuring agreement.\\u2019 \",\"On November 28, 2016, China Eximbank signed a $194,740,598.46 buyer's credit loan agreement [NO. BLA2016K001] with the Government of Kenya for Phase 1 of the Kibwezi-Mutomo-Kitui (B7) Highway Project. The BCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 15.5 year maturity (final maturity date: July 21, 2032) and a 3% interest rate. The proceeds of the BCL are to be used by the borrower to partially finance a 23,394,790,000 Ksh (approximately $230 million) commercial contract with China Hydropower International Co., Ltd.  The lender made disbursements worth $156,960,922.36 prior to July 1, 2021 and disbursements worth $37,195,454.30 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was $156,960,922.36 as of June 30, 2020, $156,960,922.36 as of June 30, 2021, and $194,156,376.66 as of June 30, 2022.   Phase 1 of the project involves the tarmacking of the 192 km, B7 highway.  The highway begins at the junction with A8 (Nairobi-Mombasa road) near Kibwezi town and runs in a northward direction via Ikutha, Mutomo, Kitui, Kabati and ends at Migwani. Upon completion, it is envisioned that this highway will encourage development of critical infrastructure facilities such as power, water, telecommunications, and social infrastructure in the regions traversed as well as support the long term development and viability of the Mombasa-Isiolo-Moyale corridor, and Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) corridor, while linking three more regional transport corridors which are the Northern Corridor (A8), the Kenya-Ethiopia Corridor (A2) and the Thika-Garissa-Liboi (A3).   China Hydropower International Co., Ltd (\\u4e2d\\u6c34\\u7535\\u56fd\\u9645\\u516c\\u53f8) -- also known as Sinohydro -- is the contractor responsible for project implementation.  The Kenya National Highways Authority is responsible for overseeing its work. Construction began on December 6, 2016. The project had achieved a 53% complete rate as of May 2019. Its originally expected completion date was February 15, 2021.   However, the project has encountered major implementation delays due to land acquisition challenges, the relocation of power line alongs the road corridor, delayed payments, a shortage of water for the works, and a temporary suspension of work by contractor due to COVID-19 cases reported in Kitui. Local residents have also complained about the noise, dust, and pollution that has resulted from construction activities.\",\"On October 20, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Philippines signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on financing cooperation. Then, on November 15, 2017, the two parties signed a financing cooperation agreement on the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The Government of Philippines\\u2019 National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Investment Coordination Committee approved the project on April 25, 2018. Approximately five months later, on September 21, 2018, the Government of Philippines submitted a loan application to China Eximbank.   Then, on November 20, 2018, China Eximbank and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) \\u2014 a government agency in the Philippines that is in charge of water privatization in Metro Manila \\u2014 signed a $211,214,646.54 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [No.I420I0300202018213220 and CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2018 NO.25 TOTAL NO.48] for the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20-year maturity period, a 7-year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee ($633,643.94). The loan effectiveness date was on November 1, 2019, and MWSS paid the entire management fee ($633,643.94) to China Eximbank on November 26, 2019. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a PHP 12,189,893,798.70 commercial (EPC) contract [No.NCWS-KDP 001-2018] between MWSS and China Energy Engineering Corporation Limited (CEEC).   The purpose of the project is to construct the Kaliwa Dam, including intake facilities and other facilities, and a 57 million cubic meter reservoir. The project involves the construction of a water conveyance tunnel that is expected to supply 2,400 million liters per day of raw water for Metro Manila, thereby reducing dependence on the Angat Dam reservoir. Upon completion, the project is also expected to benefit some 17.46 million people or about 3.49 million households of Metro Manila, Rizal, and Quezon. The Kaliwa dam is located in the municipalities of General Nakar and Infanta in Quezon Province and the municipality of Teresa in Rizal Province.   CEEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. EDCOP, PRIMEX, and SMEC are also involved in the project as subcontractors. An environmental compliance certificate (ECC) [No. ECC-CO-1907-0017] for the project was issued by the Government of the Philippines\\u2019 Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on October 11, 2019. But DENR Undersecretary Benny Antiporda was quoted as saying that \\u201cthe ECC was issued because it was a priority project of the government and the agency had no recourse but to approve it.\\u201d A notice to proceed was issued to the EPC contractor on November 13, 2019.   By May 2020, there were only a few more kilometers of access road (to the planned reservoir in General Nakar town in Quezon) left to construct to reach the main dam site. As of December 31, 2020, the project had achieved a 2.48% completion rate. As of March 2021, it had achieved a 9.44% completion rate. Then, on June 29, 2021, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place.    A June 2021 report quoted MWSS as saying that tunnel excavation for the Kaliwa Dam would be ready to begin in December 2021, with the planned arrival of the tunnel boring machine to the Port of Manila slated for July 2021. Construction continued throughout 2021, despite the fact that the project did not have permits from the appropriate government agencies, opened up the possibility that the ECC issued for the project would be revoked. According to the Commission on Audit (COA), MWSS and CEEC must first comply with the requirements of the National Integrated Protected Areas Systems Act and have a certification issued by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. It must also identify disposal sites of excavated materials, among others. If these requirements are not met, the COA has warned that the ECC may be cancelled, which would jeopardize the loan agreement with China Eximbank and the commercial contract with CEEC. The project has generated a great deal of local criticism, with some people warning that the dam could destroy the ecosystems and habitats of indigenous people in several Quezon province towns.   After granting the project\\u2019s ECC, the Government of the Philippines downplayed the threat of a sizable flood occurring in the case of structural damage to the dam caused by an earthquake. Public officials claimed that there are no active faults near the dam. The New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project also threatens to displace up to 10,000 members of the Dumagat-Remontado indigenous people group who live in the project area. These Dumagat communities depend on farming for a majority of their income as well as working for Sierra Madre hikers. The loss of their farmland leaves their economic future uncertain. The project site is also the location of sites sacred to the Dumagat people. The Government of the Philippines claims that only 46 families stand to be affected by the project.   In March 2019, Marcelino Tena, President of Samahan ng mga Katutubong Agta-Dumagat-Remontado na Binabaka at Ipinagtatanggol ang Lupaing Ninuno (SAGIBIN-LN), alleged that MWSS \\u201cdid not follow the right process to secure the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC),\\u201d adding that the engineering design had not been shown to them. In contrast, then-MWSS administrator Reynaldo Velasco claimed that only about 46 families would be affected, that several consultations with those who would be affected had been made, and that the project design had yet to be finalized. The controversy led to the creation of the \\u201cSTOP Kaliwa Dam\\u201d (SKD) organization. Also known as Sectors and Peoples Totally Opposed to Kaliwa Dam, the organization claims representation from indigenous peoples, local communities, church leaders, academics, environmentalists, and social movements. The group has started a signature campaign from all over the Philippines to petition Duterte to stop the project.   By September 2019, the official MWSS website reported that three successful public hearings initiated by DENR-EMB and the MWSS had been conducted, as follows: at General Nakar, Quezon on August 23, 2019, at Teresa, Rizal on August 27, 2019; and at Infanta, Quezon on August 28, 2019. In connection with the free, prior, and informed consent, the site has this to say: \\u201cWith regard to MWSS\\u2019 compliance with Republic Act No. 8173 or the Indigenous People\\u2019s Rights Acts, the MWSS through the National Commission of Indigenous Peoples has successfully completed the community assemblies on the six (6) clusters of IP communities in Quezon Province as part of the Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process (emphasis supplied).\\u201d However, according to Mavic Conde, five out of six cluster communities in General Nakar\\u2014one of the two municipalities in Quezon province where the NCWS-KDP will be located (the other one is Infanta)\\u2014 voted overwhelmingly no, effectively rejecting the project. The five clusters consist of those in Lumutan, Baybay, Pasanghan, Umiray, and Cablao.   Also, Aaron Pedrosa, attorney for the progressive political party Sanlakas, alleged that MWSS failed to provide proof of compliance with the procedural requirement of posting a public notice and a copy of the scoping report as proof that public scoping was conducted in the area as part of the environmental impact study. These allegations and counter-allegations have given rise to serious legal questions relating to the issuance of the ECC in the absence of a valid consultation process.\",\"The National Water Supply and Drainage Board of Sri Lanka (NWSDB) received an unsolicited conceptual proposal from China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) to implement the Gampaha, Attanagalla, Minuwangoda Integrated Water Supply Scheme (GAMWSS) in 2010, along with a letter of intent issued by China Development Bank (CDB) to grant a credit line for GAMWSS and an endorsement letter issued by the Chinese Embassy. A Project Assessment Committee (PAC) subsequently reviewed the conceptual proposal submitted by CMEC in June 2010. In its report, the PAC noted that CMEC had limited experience with water supply projects and the qualifications listed were that of an associate company, the Tianjin Water Industry Engineering & Equipment Co. Ltd (TWIEE). Hence, the PAC noted that the project should only be implemented jointly by both these companies. The NWSDB submitted the project concept note for the approval of the Government of Sri Lanka\\u2019s National Planning Department (NPD) and Standing Cabinet Appointed Review Committee (SCARC) in July 2010. The total cost of the project which was submitted for NPD approval in July 2010 was just LKR 10,675 million ($94 million), which amounted to just 32% of the final contracted value of the project (which was LKR 33,060 million or $229.5 million). Based on the recommendation by SCARC, Sri Lanka\\u2019s Cabinet of Ministers approved the request for technical and financial proposals from CMEC on July 31, 2010.   Sri Lanka\\u2019s Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage (MOWSD) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the CMEC on November 15, 2010. According to the MOU, CMEC was to submit the technical and financial proposals by January 31, 2011. The MOU does not refer to funding from CDB, and states instead that the parties will support each other to secure \\u2018preferably a concessional loan from EXIM Bank of China\\u2019, which suggests that the initial funding offer from the CDB had been rejected during the approval process and a request had been made to secure a loan from China Eximbank in its place. It also indicates that at the time of signing the MOU, there was no firm commitment from China Eximbank to provide funding for the project. Despite the lack of a firm commitment on funding, and without having seen technical and financial proposals from CMEC, the MOWSD agreed in the MOU not to \\u2018solicit or initiate any proposals or respond to any proposals from any other party\\u2019 for the implementation of the project. According to the MOU, this commitment remains valid (unless both parties agree in writing to withdraw from the project) up to 77 days from the date of signing the MOU and can be further extended if there had been delays attributable to either party.   The Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) that reviewed the technical and financial proposals received from CMEC submitted its report on July 31, 2012. The initial price quoted by CMEC was $258 million, 50% higher than the total cost estimate (TCE) of the project prepared by NWSDB engineers of $172 million. This engineer\\u2019s estimate had factored in a 25% profit margin for the contractor as well. The TEC noted that the CMEC had quoted very high prices for certain civil works and in order to reduce these costs, the NWSDB agreed to undertake the implementation of these civil work items including the Basnagoda reservoir as a sub-contractor. The price quoted by the CMEC for this component was $72 million and NWSDB agreed to complete this work for $64 million, resulting in a saving of $8 million. By the time the MOWSD submitted a memorandum to the Cabinet of Ministers on September 3, 2012, the contract price had been further reduced to $232.5 million. This was still 35.2% higher than the TCE prepared by the NWSDB engineers which already had a 25% profit margin factored into it.   The Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA), an organization tasked with ensuring that SOEs and statutory boards such as the NWSDB are sustainably managed, requested the government to reconsider awarding the contract to CMEC. SEMA noted in its observations that CMEC has already caused numerous problems for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as the primary contractor of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant. SCARC appears to have conducted a second round of negotiations with the contractor \\u2014 in response to a request made by the Cabinet of Ministers on September 26, 2012 \\u2014 to further reduce the gap between TCE and the contract price. During the meeting SCARC held on October 10, 2012, the TCE was first increased from $172 million to $197 million considering the inflation due to the delay in the project start year from 2012 to 2014 (the original TCE had assumed that the project would commence in 2012). The TCE was further increased from $197 million to $216.7 million considering the potential future appreciation of the Chinese yuan (RMB) against the US dollar (USD). The SCARC, noting that the original TCE by the engineers had factored in a 25% profit margin, had requested that CMEC reduce its contract price from $232.5 million to $216.7 million. However, CMEC refused to do so citing the rapid appreciation of the RMB and the price reduction already made from $258 million to $232.5 million. CMEC agreed to bring down the contract price to $229.5 million. Following this meeting held on the October 10, 2012, the SCARC made a recommendation to the Cabinet of Ministers to award the contract to CMEC for $229.49 million.   On May 9, 2013, the Cabinet gave its approval to award the contract to CMEC based on the recommendation of the SCARC and instructed the Ministry and the External Resources Department (ERD) to work towards obtaining a preferential buyers\\u2019 credit (PBC) from China Eximbank to fund the project. On May 15, 2013, the NWSDB signed the commercial contract with CMEC for the implementation of GAMWSS, agreeing to pay CMEC for the design, execution and completion of the works a sum of $229.49 million. CMEC signed a sub-contract with NWSDB for the Civil Works and the Basnagoda Reservoir on October 6, 2014. Then, on August 29, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $195,075,000 (approximately Rs. 28.4 billion) loan agreement for the Gampaha, Attanagalla, and Miniwangoda Integrated Water Supply Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $229.49 million commercial contract [ID#P&P/DB/CHINA EXIM/GAMIWS S/2013/01], which was signed with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) on May 15, 2013. The remaining 15 percent ($34.5 million) was borrowed from Bank of Ceylon, a state-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka, on January 16, 2017.   The purpose of the project is to provide safe and reliable drinking water to the areas of the Gampaha, Minuwangoda, and Attanagalla Divisional Secretariat (DS) divisions and part of Meerigama Divisional Secretariat (DS) division. The project involves the construction of a Basnagoda 3.5 MCM capacity impounding reservoir at Karasnagala, the construction of a 85,000 m3/day capacity water intake facility at Karasnagala, the construction of a 54,000 m3/day capacity Water Treatment Plant (WTP) at Karasnagala, the construction of a wastewater and sludge treatment facility including all accessories and pumping equipment at the treatment plant premises, the construction of 10,000 m3 capacity High Level Reservoir (HLR) at Nikahetikanda, the construction of five 1,500 m3 capacity elevated water towers at Ranpokunugama, Belummahara, Naiwala, Minuwangoda and Pasyala, the supply and laying of 1,000 mm diameter Ductile Iron (DI) pipes for raw water pumping main of 1.75 km length approximately from the water intake to the WTP, the supply and laying of 1,000 mm dia. DI pipes for treated water pumping main of 1.65 km length approximately from the WTP to the high-level reservoir (HLR), the supply and laying of 1,100 mm dia. to 150mm dia. range DI pipes for the gravity transmission main approximate length of 89.2 km from the HLR to existing and new water towers, supply and laying of 225 mm dia. to 90 mm dia. range uPVC pipes for the distribution network, approximate length of 600 km, supply and laying of 400 mm dia. to 300 mm dia. range DI pipes for balance part of the distribution network, approximate length of 30 km, and finally catchment protection. In total, the project seeks to build a 720 km water pipe network. Upon completion, the project is expected to provide about 600,000 residents in Gampaha, Attanagalla and Minuwangoda with clean drinking water.  Tianjin Municipal Engineering Design & Research Institute is responsible for project design and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 5, 2014 (prior to loan approval). However, project implementation did not commence until February 2017. As of January 31, 2018, the Sri Lankan Department of Project Management and Monitoring reported that the project had achieved a \\u2018physical progress\\u2019 rate of 20.27%. As of December 2018, the project has achieved a \\u2018physical progress\\u2019 rate of approximately 50%. As of early 2021, the project had achieved a \\u2018physical progress\\u2019 rate of 68.9%. Although the project was originally scheduled to reach completion in February 2020, the scheduled project completion date was subsequently revised to February 2022 due to various implementation delays.  This project has been plagued by controversy. In May 2018, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga demanded that this project be suspended and investigated on the grounds that it was overpriced. Even while the Rajapaksa administration was still in power, a Cabinet-appointed procurement committee noticed a major difference between the cost estimated by the NWSDB engineers for pipe laying and other activities and the higher prices estimated by CMEC. However, a review committee set up after the 2015 change of government recommended the continuation of the project. The Auditor General\\u2019s (AG) Department also raised concerns about the qualifications of CMEC to undertake such a major project. It noted that the company\\u2019s portfolio showed no specialization in water supply projects and that in the experience section of CMEC\\u2019s project proposal it listed the experience of several other companies (China National Machinery Import and Export Cooperation and Tianjin Water Industry Engineering and Equipment Co. Ltd.). The AG Department also highlighted that even though government procurement guidelines state that only a maximum of 20 percent can be paid as an advance to a contractor, an advance payment of 34 percent was made to CMEC. Then, in a letter dated May 17, 2018, to the Secretary of the Treasury, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge, the Attorney General recommended that a complaint be filed at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) since it appeared that the project was mired in graft.   This project has also encountered debt repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Development Bank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement. As of March 2023, the Government of Sri Lanka had accumulated $338 million in arrears to China Development Bank.\",\"In November 2017, a group of banks provided a syndicated loan of $2.73 billion to Corredor Log\\u00edstico Integrado De Nacala SA \\u2014 a project company and special purpose vehicle owned by Vale (85% equity stake) and Mitsui (15% equity stake) \\u2014 for the Nacala Corridor Railway and Port Project. This loan carries a maturity of 14 years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 190 basis points. The interest rate is calculated using the average 6-month LIBOR of 1.626% from November 2017 plus 190 basis points = 3.526%. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) reportedly contributed $200 million to this loan syndicate. Other funders were Mizuho Bank, Ltd., the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), African Development Bank and other eight private financial institutions.   The purpose of the project is to construct the railway and port infrastructure that is needed to transport and export coal produced from the Moatize coal mine in Mozambique. It involves the construction of a 912 km railway that connects the Moatize coal mine developed by Vale S.A. and Mitsui & Co, Ltd. in Tete to the port of Nacala through part of Malawi. The railway has three sections: (1) the Nacala-to-Velha section that connects the village of Andre Mossuril to the town of Nacala-a-Velha; (2) the Lumbo section that connects the city of Monapo to the port village of Lumbo; and (3) the Cuamba-Lichinga section that connects the town of Cuamba to the city of Lichinga. The project also involves the construction of an export terminal and a coal storage yard at the port of Nacala-a-Velha. Upon completion, the project will facilitate rail and ship transport of produced coal up to a volume of 18 million tons per annum. China Communications Construction Group Ltd. was one of the contractors involved in that implementation of this project. A groundbreaking ceremony for this project took place on May 12, 2017. On Janurary 20th, 2021, Mitsui & Co decided to sell its equity stake to Vale. \",\"In Fiscal Year 2017-2018, Bank of China provided a $200 million loan to the State Bank of Pakistan to shore up the country\\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 3 year maturity and an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR (2.307%) plus a 2% margin. \",\"On June 25, 2012, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Argentina's Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $2,099,965,834 syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit facility (loan) agreement for the Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Rehabilitation Project. CDB contributed $1,899,965.834 to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#36517) and ICBC contributed $200,000,000 to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#69134). The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4.5 year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus an 2.9% margin, a default (penalty) interest rate of 2%, a commitment fee of 0.125%, an an upfront (one-time) management fee of 0.20%. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy from Sinosure worth 7.21% of the face value of the loan ($151,407,536.63).   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $2,470,548,040 commercial contract between Argentina\\u2019s Ministry of the Interior and Transport and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on March 11, 2010.   As of May 2022, the loan had achieved an 88.3% disbursement rate ($1,855,660,000 out of $2,099,965,834). The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $504,821,918.39 as of December 31, 2015, $1,230,795,697.28 as of December 31, 2017, $1,478,957,102.66 as of December 31, 2019 and $1,376,381,351.22 as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to replace 1593 km of track along the Belgrano Freight Railway, which stretches from Retiro station in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires through a total of 14 Argentine provinces: Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, C\\u00f3rdoba, San Luis, Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Tucum\\u00e1n, Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy. The rail network even connects with two neighboring countries: one of its branches links with Chile through the Socompa border crossing in Salta province, continuing to the port of Antofagasta on the Pacific. There are two alternative connections with Bolivia, neither of which are currently operating. The first is through La Quiaca in Jujuy province, the second through Salvador Mazza in Salta province. The project also involves the acquisition of 1000 wagons and 30 locomotives. These activities will be implemented as part of the Argentine government\\u2019s Belgrano Plan, which is a set of transportation, infrastructure, production, health, employment, housing, and education policies and programs that target the country's northern provinces.   The rail replacement work is scheduled to take place in three phases. Work on the first phase will cover 535 km and it includes the Santurce-Tostado-Chorotis-Las Bre\\u00f1as section, the Pampa del Infierno-Los Frentones section, and the Los Pirpintos-Los Tigres-Taco Pozo sections in Santa Fe, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero provinces. Work on the second phase is 500 km in length and it includes the Coronda-Santo Tom\\u00e9 and Laguna Paiva-Nar\\u00e9 sections, both in Santa Fe province, and Talavera-Pichanal-Embarcaci\\u00f3n-Chalic\\u00e1n, between Salta and Jujuy. The third phase of the project is 558 km in length and it includes refurbishment of the Tucum\\u00e1n-Met\\u00e1n-Joaqu\\u00edn V. Gonz\\u00e1lez and Met\\u00e1n-Chalic\\u00e1n sections in Tucum\\u00e1n, Salta, and Jujuy provinces. These activities are expected to generate 23,000 jobs, including both direct and indirect employment. The project implies major logistical work, including the transportation of more than 2 million sleepers, 170,000 tons of rail, and 5 million tons of ballast stone.   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corporation (CSR) and CRRC Qishuyan \\u2014a subsidiary of the CRRC Corporation Limited \\u2014are also involved in the project as subcontractors.   An official project commencement ceremony took place on July 18, 2014. However, construction activities did not begin until December 2014. The project was originally expected to reach completion within two years (December 2016). CMEC had delivered 107 locomotives and 2500 carriages by February 2017.  Then, in January 2018, locomotives manufactured by China's CRRC Qishuyan arrived in Argentina. On May 31, 2019, President Macri attended the inauguration ceremony of the first 700 km of renewed railway tracks of the Belgrano Cargas train in the town of Joaquin V. Gonzalez in Salta province. As of May 2022, the project had achieved a 77.96% completion rate.  The Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Rehabilitation Project was at risk of cancellation and loan default in 2016. On July 18, 2014, Argentina\\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $4,714,350,000 syndicated term loan facility agreement with three Chinese state-owned banks (Bank of China, China Development Bank, and ICBC) for the construction of two hydroelectric dams (the so-called Kirchner-Cepernic dams) on the Santa Cruz River in Patagonia. The loan agreement included a cross-default clause, stating that if the borrower canceled the project, CDB financing for a separate project (the $2,099,965,834 loan for the Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Project) would also be cancelled. In November 2015, newly elected Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced his intention to suspend the construction of the Kirchner-Cepernic dams. These dams are located on the Santa Cruz River near the famous Perito Moreno Glacier (UNESCO World Heritage Site) that feeds from the same river, and the Macri administration considered these dams to be too risky on environmental grounds. When President Macri first announced his intention to suspend the project, CDB, ICBC, and Bank of China had already disbursed $950 million under the syndicated term loan agreement.   Then, on March 10, 2016, CDB sent a warning letter to Argentina's Finance Minister, Alfonso Prat Gay, The letter said: \\\"The Kirchner-Cepernic dams and the Belgrano Cargas are major projects promoted by the Chinese Communist Party and signed during the same political time period in Argentina and each one of the ... facility agreements contain cross-default clauses.\\\" The Macri administration subsequently reversed course and announced that it no longer intended to suspend construction of the Nestor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Dams. \",\"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as \\u2018Samruk-Kazyna\\u2019). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as \\u2018Kazakhmys Corporation LLC\\u2019 and \\u2018Kazakhmys\\u2019) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC \\u2014 and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower \\u2018principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.\\u2019 As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

The project sought to establish facilities able to mine 30 million tons per year. A $560 million EPC contract for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was signed between KAZ Minerals PLC and Alarko Contracting Group on September 20, 2011. China Nonferrous Metal Industry\\u2019s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was also involved in the project\\u2019s complementation. Mobilization work started in March 2012 and construction of the temporary site building and facilities were completed in the same year. Approximately 42.000 m\\u00b3 of concrete production and 5.000 tons of steel construction were completed by May 2013. The panel coating works of the process buildings started in May 2013. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on March 15, 2015.  The completion of construction activities and the commencement of commissioning works was ultimately held on September 29, 2016. The Bozymchak mine is an open-pit copper and gold mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region, Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan (exact locational coordinates: 41.2586, 71.0647). It is estimated to contain combined indicated and inferred resources of 16.5 million tons with 0.95% copper and 1.58 g/t gold. The scope of the project involved the development of the mine and its ancillary facilities. NFC was responsible for implementation. The project\\u2019s pre-feasibility study was completed in July 2008. It was originally expected to reach completion by December 2014. However, the mine was not initially commissioned until March 2014. The mine was fully commissioned and reached its commercial operations date (COD) on or around August 5, 2015. The Bozymchak mine restarted operations on December 26, 2020 after a temporary suspension that began on October 7, 2020, following political instability in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Abyz copper mine and the Nurkazgan copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 50.16861, 73.00333). Stripping works at Abyz mine commenced in January 2014. At that time, it was expected that the mine would recommence production in Q3 of 2014. The Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Akbastau-Kosmurun copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 48.60611,77.78861 and 48.6437, 77.7102). The project commenced on January 30, 2009. Its completion date is unknown. The Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Zhomart copper mine, which exploits the 14 km long Zhaman-Aybat orefield deposits that are located approximately 160 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The first stage of the mine\\u2019s development was commissioned in 2006 with a planned capacity of around 4 million tons of ore a year. The second phase of the project was schedule for implementation from 2012 to 2017 with a production start in 2018. The de facto completion date of the $300 million loan that Samruk-Kazyna contracted for an unspecified purpose was January 2013 (when it was fully repaid).\",\"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as \\u2018Samruk-Kazyna\\u2019). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as \\u2018Kazakhmys Corporation LLC\\u2019 and \\u2018Kazakhmys\\u2019) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC \\u2014 and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower \\u2018principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.\\u2019 As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

Huazhong Power International Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 19, 2019. The project is still under implementation; but on July 24, 2021, the first station of the Laos substation was put online. The expected completion date of the project is April 2022.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos\\u2019 gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, \\u2018[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by \\u00c9lectricit\\u00e9 du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. [\\u2026] EDL\\u2019s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL\\u2019s total operating revenue.\\u2019 The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, \\u2018[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021\\u2019 and \\u2019[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.\\u2019  The country\\u2019s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People\\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 \\u2014 when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was \\u2018rolled over\\u2019 for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos\\u2014a large part of the country\\u2019s electricity transmission grid\\u2014from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as \\u00c9lectricit\\u00e9 du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country\\u2019s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank\\u2019s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).\",\"On May 12, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a preferential buyer credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC. No (2017) 8 TOTAL No. (434)] worth $218,692,386 for Phase 2 of the Aysha Wind Power Project. On July 5, 2017, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under Proclamation No.1044/2017. The proclamation went into effect on August 3, 2017. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $257,285,160 commercial (EPC) contract between Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) and Dongfang Electric Corporation, which was signed on January 15, 2016.  According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $218,692,386 (ETB 3,216,027,397) PBC achieved a 34% disbursement rate as of October 28, 2019, with China Eximbank making 3 loan disbursements (worth $59,759.07180 or ETB 1,727,628,763) between 2018 and 2019: a $12,882,512.77 (ETB 355,185,058) disbursement on June 29, 2018, a $12,244,641.29 (ETB 355,832,746) disbursement on August 9, 2019, and a $34,631,917.74 (ETB 1,016,610,959) disbursement on October 25, 2019.   The purpose of the project is to install 80 wind turbines with a single unit capacity of 1.5 megawatts with a total installed capacity of 120 megawatts. The project also involves the construction of access roads for operation and maintenance (O&M), the construction of one 230kV step-up substation connected to the 230kV national grid, and provision of training to the O&M team. The EPC contract with Dongfang Electric Corporation also specifies a 5-year Defect Liability Period. Once operational, the wind farm is expected to have an annual power output of 467 gigawatt-hours and provide power to the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway and the Dire Dawa Industrial Park. It is also expected to ensure stable and sufficient power for the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Economic Corridor. Additionally, it is envisaged that part of the electricity that Aysha wind farm generates will be exported to Djibouti to generate foreign exchange for Ethiopia.   The project site is located in the Shenelle Zone of the Ethiopian Somali State some 465 km north-east of Addis Ababa. Dongfang Electric Corporation is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   The implementation of the project commenced on February 25, 2017 and it was originally expected to reach completion within 18 months (August 25, 2018). However, a formal groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until May 2018 and the project has encountered various delays and implementation problems. First, EEPCO was unable to pay an advance payment to Dongfang Electric Corporation (per the contractual schedule) due to \\u2018financial constraints\\u2019. Second, wind turbine installation has proven challenging due to high and variable wind speeds, which have made it difficult to lift heavy load; the nacelle, tower and generator had to be hoisted into place when the wind speed was less than 10m/s. Third, due to high temperature, most of the concrete pouring of the WTG foundation had to be done at night. Fourth, land compensation and right of way issues led to implementation problems. When Dongfang Electric Corporation started site works after receiving right of way from EEPCO, some people started to build dwelling near the project site and Dongfang Electric Corporation was forced to stop site work. Fifth, there was a delay of cement supply from a local factory due to projects\\u2019 priority by government. Sixth, construction was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In late March 2020, Dongfang Electric Corporation was delivering equipment \\u2014 including a wind turbine, a generator and a tower \\u2014 from Djibouti Port to the project site in Ethiopia. But at that time Ethiopia had just shut down its border to minimize the spread of the coronavirus, which left four Chinese technicians stranded in Ethiopia. Dongfang Electric Corporation then sent technicians from its headquarters in China to enable the work required to transport the equipment. That action reportedly prevented the construction work from grinding to a halt. On July 12, 2021, Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC) held an online open house event at the Aysha Wind Farm Project.   As of August 2021, the project had reportedly achieved a 75% completion rate and generated more than 300 local jobs. The project's scheduled completion date was eventually pushed back until the end of 2022.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase II of the Aysha Wind Power Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On January 30, 2012, China Development Bank (CDB) provided a $2.115 billion loan to Taurus Mineral Limited, of which $1.175 billion was used to acquire the Hushan uranium mine (\\u6e56\\u5c71\\u923e\\u7926, Lake Mountain) from Extract Resources (Pty) Ltd.

Then, on April 13, 2012, Extract Resources (Pty) Ltd announced that its securities would be removed from the official list of ASX Limited, meaning that Taurus Mineral Limited had successfully acquired a 98.37% ownership stake Extract Resources (Pty) Ltd (and by extension the Hushan uranium mine).   After Taurus Mineral Ltd. became the majority shareholder in Extract Resources (Pty) Ltd and thus the majority shareholder in Swakop Uranium (Pty) Ltd, it provided a $214,920,326 loan \\u2014 through Extract Resources (Pty) Ltd -- to Epangelo Mining Company (a Namibian state-owned company) to facilitate its acquisition of a 10 percent stake in the Husab Uranium Mine. This loan agreement was finalized in November 2012 and its face value was increased to $258,920,326 in 2015. The loan carries a 15 year maturity and an interest rate of 6.155% (calculated by adding the average LIBOR rate from November 2012, .155, with a 6% margin= 6.155%). It is to be repaid by Epangelo Mining Company with future dividends from the Husab Uranium Mine Development Project over a 15 year period. The purpose of the Husab Uranium Mine Development Project (also known as the Husab Uranium Project) is to make Namibia the second largest uranium producer in the world. Project ID#61252 captures the $1.175 billion loan from CDB. This project records the $258,920,326 loan from Taurus Mineral Limited via Extract Resources (Pty) Ltd.  The Husab Mine is currently under construction and was scheduled to produce its first uranium in the first quarter of 2016. Commencement of mining operation has already started as of 8 March 2014. The mine was scheduled to commence cold commissioning in 2015 but the process has been delayed due to commissioning-related problems.\",\"On May 23, 2016, Oman Wanfang LLC, a Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) and Oman\\u2019s Special Economic Zone Authority in Duqm (SEZAD), signed an usufruct-investment agreement establishing the project.

The loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding was $0 as of December 31, 2016, $0 as of December 31, 2017, $56,615,003 as of December 31, 2018, $97,638,920 as of December 31, 2019, $97,638,920 as of December 31, 2020, and $158,064,129 as of December 31, 2021. The project involves construction of 21 bridges, 360 sewers, 16 bus stops, 2 toll and weigh stations, 2 roundabouts in Charagua, 2 overpasses for the crossing of the railway line, and 1 viaduct, among things. The localities that will benefit from the project are Tacobo, Yaguarenda, El Espino, Guariri, Masavi, Takuru, Saipir\\u00fa, Taput\\u00e1, Guirapukuti, Pirit\\u00ed, Charagua, Machipo, Pueblo Nuevo, San Antonio de Parapet\\u00ed, Ipitakuape, Itatiki, Camatindi and Boyuibe. The road will connect these localities with the city of Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, Tarija and with the Republic of Paraguay. The contractor is China Railway Group. This 159.4 km road construction project has entered implementation. The Bolivian Highway Administration (ABC) issued an order to commence work to China Railway Group Limited on June 16, 2017. The project entered implementation at the end of 2017 and was expected to take 36 months to complete. The road was about 50% complete as of February 8, 2020. The project was delayed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but was reactivated in mid-2021. \",\"On August 24, 2016, the Government of Bangladesh awarded a contract to a Chinese consortium comprised of ZTE Corporation and ZTE Holdings to upgrade the fixed network of Bangladeshi state-owned Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL). At that time, the Chinese Government pledged to finance 90% of the total cost of the project. Then, on September 27, 2016, BTCL signed a commercial contract with ZTE Corporation and ZTE Holding Co., Ltd. for the project.   Approximately one year later, on September 10, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed a preferential loan framework agreement in which the Chinese Government agreed in principle to issue an RMB 1,547,071,939.09 ($231.5 million) loan for the Modernization of Telecommunication Network for Digital Connectivity Project (MOTN). However, there were delays in the signing of the formal loan agreement because the Government of Bangladesh and BTCL were concerned with the higher-than-expected cost of the contract with ZTE. BTCL negotiated with ZTE and managed to reduce the cost, which enabled the project to proceed. Then, on April 10, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 1,547,071,939.09 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for MOTN Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a maturity period of 21 years, a grace period of 6 years, and a commitment fee (service charge rate) of 0.2%. In addition to the China Eximbank loan, the Government of Bangladesh was expected to contribute \\u09f37,561,100,000 BDT of counterpart financing for the MOTN project. According to the Government of Bangladesh\\u2019s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the GCL had achieved a disbursement rate of 19.9% (RMB 309,414,000 out of RMB 1,547,071,939.09) as of June 30, 2019, 49.8% (RMB 771,139,000 out of RMB 1,547,071,939.09) as of June 30, 2020 and 66.6% (RMB 1,030,397,000 out of RMB 1,547,071,939.09) as of June 30, 2021. No repayments on the GCL had been made as of June 30, 2020 or June 30, 2021.   The purpose of the project is to upgrade the fixed network of BTCL in order to provide a wider, modernized, and cheap range of IP telephony, high-speed Internet, and converged services including video calling and videoconferencing over BTCL\\u2019s PSTN access lines, to compete better against mobile alternatives. The MOTN project involves the replacement of BTCL's public switched telephone network system (PSTN) with a IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem)-based telephone system using Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) technology that would cover all of Bangladesh's districts with the requisite transmission and IP networks. Upon completion, the project is expected to fulfill the Government of Bangladesh's \\u2018Vision-2021\\u2019 plan and help secure a Digital Bangladesh, More specifically, the MOTN project is expected to divide Bangladesh's IMS Core Exchanges into three parts: Dhaka, Chittagong, and Khulna, each with a capacity of 1,600,000 subscribers. It is also expected to replace old IP exchanges with IP-based Exchange Access gateways.   The MOTN project also involves the creation of eight rings in several Bangladeshi districts, including Dhaka and Chittagong, that would allow the transmission backbone to be more reliable. It also includes the installation of a pair of core routers in Chittagong, Dhaka, and Khulna. A national operations center with 21 large monitors capable of monitoring the network will be created by the project. A submarine cable connection through Cox's Baxar and Kuawakata, through India via Benapole, is also supposed to be established to improve the network's resiliency.   Additionally, the project will develop a computerized model using BTCL's existing optical fiber and the MOTN upgrades in order to better monitor the optical fiber network status. ZTE Corporation is the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation and Bangladesh's Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology is responsible for project supervision. The Government Bangladesh's Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) approved the project on October 17, 2017.   The project was expected to take 3 years to implementation. ZTE reportedly began work in January 2019. However, the project's official commencement ceremony was held on January 8, 2020. The project implementation period was originally expected to take place between July 2017 and June 2020. However, a revised Development Project Proposal (DPP) was sent to Bangladesh's Posts and Telecommunications Division for approval by the ECNEC; the DPP proposed the extension of the project implementation period by an additional two years and an increase in the project cost to \\u09f333,749,400,000 BDT from \\u09f325,733,900,000 BDT. The new expected completion time was June 30 2022. On September 15, 2020, the project\\u2019s Business Operation and Support System (BOSS) and Network Operation Center (NOC) were launched, which signified that the project was entering a new (commercial use) phase. The COVID-19 pandemic led to various project implementation challenges and delays. Additionally due to heavy rains and floods, the project encountered significant problems, including the destruction of fiber and trench damage. A controversy also arose when a Bangladesh newspaper, The New Nation, alleged that ZTE had \\u2018arm-twisted [the] Ministry of Post and Telecommunication into buying additional switch boards\\u2019 for MOTN even though said switch boards were reportedly \\u2018substandard and useless.\\u2019    As of July 2023, the Government of Bangladesh reports the project as 75% complete. \",\"On August 31, 2017, the Chinese Government agreed to provide an RMB 1.5 billion grant ($230 million) grant to the Government of Tajikistan for the Government Complex and Parliamentary Complex Construction Project (captured by this project). Then, in 2018, the Chinese Government committed an additional RMB 900 million in grant funding for the same project (captured by linked project ID#71727).  The purpose of the project is to finance the construction of a new parliament and government complex that is 49.7 meters high and that occupies a total area of 42,874 square meters. The project involves the construction of a 15-story building and two 13-story buildings on 10.27 hectares of land.

China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation of the project. \",\"On May 30, 2008, the Chinese Government and and the Government of Vietnam signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Cat Linh-Ha Dong Light Rail Construction Project. This subsequently produced three different loan agreements:   (1) On October 22, 2008, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.2 billion ($169 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.(14) Total No.(223)] for this railway project (Project #73326). The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: 3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.   (2) On November 8, 2009, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed a $250 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No.2009 (24) Total No. (86)] for this railway project (see Project #34616). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 4% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.   (3) On May 11, 2017, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.678 million ($250.62 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.2017 (24) Total No. (629)] for this railway project (see Project #63214). The loan terms are unknown. This GCL came into effect on December 28, 2017 and the fist disbursement took place on April 28, 2018.  The borrower was to use the proceeds from these loans to partially finance an EPC contract with China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China Railway Group. The purpose of the project is to construct a 13 km light rail \\u2014 that travels at 80 km per hour \\u2014 in the capital city of Hanoi that passes through 12 stations: Cat Linh, La Thanh, Thai Ha, Lang, Thuong Dinh, Vanh Dai 3, Phung Khoang, Van Quan, Ha Dong, La Khe, Van Khe, Yen Nghia. The project officially commenced on October 10, 2011 and the new railway line was originally scheduled to launch in June 2015, but the completion date of the project has been postponed at least four times.   The project has encountered multiple problems and delays during implementation. In 2013, the project faced difficulties related to demolition and relocation, including the fact that the terrain was ideal for machinery and the construction site was close to traffic. Then, in 2014, the total cost of the project increased from $552.86 million to $868.04 million, forcing the Government of Vietnam to contract a supplementary loan from China Eximbank (see Project #63214).   In January 2015, the project faced major criticism from the Vietnamese government for multiple accidents during construction. Vietnamese officials and experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the project\\u2019s safety, with several accidents killing or injuring workers and passersby. In early 2016, Vietnam\\u2019s Ministry of Transport and China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd agreed on a new launch date in December 2016, before correcting themselves that the line would not be launched until early 2017. In February 2017, the railway line\\u2019s completion was postponed for another year, with a new launch set for February 2018.   In February 2017, the first set of trains (out of 13 total) was installed on the track . Each train is worth $63.2 million, and manufactured by China's Beijing Subway Rolling Stock Equipment Ltd. In 2018, the project manager submitted a proposal for the railway line to begin a test run in September 2018, setting the date for an official launch to be in 2021. On September 20, 2018, the first stage of a trial run was initiated, which was meant to last 3-6 months. The project is currently slated for completion on April 30, 2021. More than 600 people were reportedly hired to support the implementation of this project.  \",\"On January 25, 2018, the Chinese Ambassador to South Sudan and the South Sudanese Finance Minister signed a preferential loan framework agreement. On the same day, the Government of South Sudan and China Eximbank signed a $248.8 million loan agreement for the Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial (EPC) contract between South Sudan Civil Aviation Authority and China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) Limited, which was signed on October 14, 2016. This loan is reportedly secured by (collateralized against) airport fees/revenues that the borrower is required to deposit in a lender-controlled escrow account.  The loan's amount outstanding was $231,952,567 as of December 2022.  The purpose of the project is to construct Juba ATMS center, a new Air Traffic control tower and operation building, a surveillance system, a navigation system, and a communication system. The Juba ATMS center is located next to Juba International Airport. The project also involves the civil engineering and supporting facilities required by the equipment (such as meteorological facilities), calibration flight test training, and other forms of training for South Sudanese technicians (to prepare them for management of the air space by 2023).   CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced in June 2020 and it was originally expected to reach completion by June 2023. On July 6, 2021, South Sudan Civil Aviation Authority (SSCAA) announced the launch of a state-of-the-art online system, which allows the opening of new routes. The newly established lower airspace, launched in partnership with aviation solutions provider NavPass, is designed to boost tourism and generate revenue for the economy, according to SSCAA. Through the system, operators of commercial, cargo, and aid aircraft can integrate Juba International Airport into their routes. \\\"Through this partnership with NavPass, South Sudan will see higher volumes of aviation trade, greater business opportunities, and improved route efficiency, safety, and reliability,\\\" explained Capt. David Subek Dada, SSCAA's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He added, \\\"This marks a crucial step towards a more prosperous future for the whole of South Sudan through additional direct and indirect economic activity.\\u201d Speaking during the launch of the air traffic management system, Tom Perkins, the CEO of NavPass said the establishment of internationally compliant and globally accessible airspace was a critical and symbolic move for the country in building economic potential, connectivity, and business. \\\"For every dollar invested in sovereign airspace, capacity translates into between five and 20 dollars of economic impact. We're proud to be working with governments across the world, including South Sudan, to optimize and monetize airspace, bridging the divide between nations,\\\" he noted. Built on the global-standard Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) system, South Sudan's airspace reportedly uses an AI-powered platform to record all flights in real-time. The system automatically collects more than 99% of eligible fees, compared with the 70-80% collected by some of the world's largest economies. NavPass chief executive, Thomas Perkins, said that apart from capturing the movement of all aircraft in the country\\u2019s skies in real-time, the technology will also automate the fee collection process with proceeds invested back into the country\\u2019s air infrastructure, in line with the United Nations\\u2019 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) principles. The revenues that are collected will reportedly be transferred into an escrow account.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In March 2023, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of South Sudan to be at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on June 14, 2023, South Sudan\\u2019s National Transport Minister Madut Biar on Wednesday revealed that CHEC had halted work its work on the ATMS Project due to delays in the payment of an outstanding bill worth $36 million. He said that the Government of South Sudan had a contractual obligation to pay CHEC $6.2 million every January 21 and July 21, but this did not happen because of a failure to pay by South Sudan's Ministry of Finance.  Two weeks later, on June 27, 2023, the Chinese Government called upon the Government of South Sudan to expedite the payment of arrears for the construction of the country\\u2019s ATMS. Speaking to Radio Tamazuj during an interview, Mu Jianjun, the Economic and Commercial Counsellor in the Chinese Embassy in South Sudan, said that China Eximbank had halted the project and was waiting for the Government of South Sudan to pay the arrears for the works done before completing the construction of the country's ATMS.

Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as \\u2018Kazakhmys Corporation LLC\\u2019 and \\u2018Kazakhmys\\u2019) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC \\u2014 and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.

The exact locational coordinates of the power plant are 31\\u00b016\\u203208\\u2033N 36\\u00b026\\u203252\\u2033E. It was envisaged that the plant would utilize Jordan\\u2019s vast reserves of oil shale and help reduce the country\\u2019s reliance upon imports of oil products for power generation. Upon completion, this plant was expected to consume around 10 million tons of oil shale per year and generate 470 megawatts of baseload power by 2021. The plant would reportedly generate enough power to meet 10-15% of Jordan's electricity needs (about 3.7 billion kWh). NEPCO would act as the plant\\u2019s sole offtaker. The total cost of this project was $2.11 billion and it was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.   On March 16, 2017, a consortium of four Chinese state-owned banks signed a $1.582 billion syndicated loan agreement with Attarat Power Company (APCO) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and project company that is owned by YTL Power International Bhd of Malaysia (45% ownership stake), Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd of China (45% ownership stake), and Eesti Energia AS (Enefit) of Estonia (10% ownerships stake) \\u2014 for the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project. The syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit loan reportedly consisted of a $594 million contribution from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (captured in Project ID#52552), a $594 million contribution from Bank of China (captured in Project ID#72499), a $244 million contribution from China Construction Bank (captured in Project ID#72500), and a $150 million contribution from China Eximbank (captured in Project ID#72502). The borrowing terms were as follows: a 15 year maturity and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.426% in March 2017) plus a 3% margin. Sinosure provided buyer\\u2019s credit insurance to the the borrower. An extensive security package was also provided to the lenders that covers all of the infrastructure and materials required to operate the plant, including over the valuable land concession from the Government of Jordan.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that APCO signed with Guangdong Power Engineering Corporation (GPEC) \\u2014 a subsidiary of China Energy Engineering Corporation \\u2014 on October 31, 2014. Under the terms of this EPC contract, GPEC agreed to undertake, on a turnkey basis, the design, engineering, procurement, construction, erection, interconnection, commissioning, start-up, testing, completion, placing in operation and delivery of the oil shale fired electric generation plant. Foster Wheeler was responsible for the provision of the circulating fluidized bed boilers. Siemens was responsible for the provision of steam turbine generators. Worley Parsons was responsible or the design of the power plant. In addition to the debt financing that was used to support this project, the shareholders in APCO agreed to provide \\u2018base shareholder funding\\u2019 (i.e. equity investments) of up to $528 million. These equity contributions were announced on March 16, 2017 after Enefit of Estonia and Near East Investment sold a 15% equity stake in APCO to YTL Power International Bhd and a 45% equity stake in APCO to Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd (see Project ID#64457). Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd is a Chinese state-owned utility that is jointly owned by Guangdong Province (76% equity stake) and China Huaneng Group (24% equity stake).   As of 2017, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project was the largest private sector investment and example of limited recourse financing in Jordan\\u2019s history. Upon completion, it was expected to have 554MW of gross power generation capacity and 477MW of net power generation capacity. It was expected to consist of two circulating-fluidized-bed units and draw oil shale from a nearby open cast mine. It was expected to employ 5,500 individuals (including 2,000 Chinese nationals) during the construction phase and 1,000 individuals each year after the construction phase is completed. On March 16, 2017, APCO issued a \\u2018notice to proceed\\u2019 to the EPC contractor (GPEC). Then, on March 20, 2017, construction began. Project implementation was suspended for two months during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, construction resumed in May 2020.   The project is ultimately expected to deliver power generation capacity in two phases: 235MW in 2020 and 235MW in 2021. APCO has entered into a 30-year agreement with NEPCO for the sale of the plant\\u2019s entire power generation capacity following its construction. The 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant project is expected to deliver capacity in two phases, 235 MW in 2H 2020 and 235 MW in 1H 2021. Unit 1 of the 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant, which also includes an open-cast mine, was synchronized with Jordan\\u2019s national grid on May 26, 2021. As of the same date, the entire project had achieved a 96% completion rate. However, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project has become a source of local controversy. To facilitate repayment of the loan (and provide a financial return to its equity holder), APCO entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with National Electric Power Corporation (NEPCO), the Jordanian state-owned power utility. NEPCO agreed to serve as the sole offtaker (i.e., single buyer) and purchase all power generated by the oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat at a price of approximately $0.17 per kilowatt hour (kWh). However, NEPCO signed several other PPAs with private companies around the same time, which resulted in too much power generation capacity and not enough customers.   As of late 2021, many of APCO\\u2019s competitors were selling electricity at $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which put NEPCO between a rock and a hard place: it is contractually obligated to purchase power from APCOM at $0.17 per kWh without enough customers to whom it can resell the power.  On December 19, 2020, NEPCO and the Government of Jordan (GOJ) initiated international arbitration proceedings against APCO with respect to the PPA and the GOJ guarantee of NEPCO\\u2019s payment obligations. NEPCO and the GOJ sought declaratory judgments that (a) the $0.17 per kWh tariff is \\u2018grossly unfair\\u2019 and (b) NEPCO can terminate the PPA if its \\u2018gross unfairness\\u2019 is not addressed. APCO has insisted that its loan agreement with ICBC, China Eximbank, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank was based on an internal rate of return (IRR) calculation of 17% (which in turn is based on the $0.17 per kWh tariff) and that it won\\u2019t be able to repay its debts if the IRR and tariff rate are downwardly revised.\",\"In January 2016, ICBC, Bank of China (Shanghai Branch), and China Construction Bank (Beijing Branch) entered into a five year, RMB 4.8 billion syndicated revolving credit facility agreement with PJSC MMC Norilsk Nickel (\\u2018 Norilsk Nickel\\u2019) \\u2014 a Russian mining and metallurgical company and the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium and a leading producer of platinum, cobalt, copper, and rhodium \\u2014 to help address the company\\u2019s medium-term liquidity needs.

This subsequently produced three different loan agreements:  (1) On October 22, 2008, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.2 billion ($169 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.(14) Total No.(223)] for this railway project (see Project #73326). The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: 3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.  (2) On November 8, 2009, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed a $250 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No.2009 (24) Total No. (86)] for this railway project (see Project #34616). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 4% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.  (3) On May 11, 2017, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.678 million ($250.62 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.2017 (24) Total No. (629)] for this railway project (Project #63214). The loan terms are unknown. This GCL came into effect on December 28, 2017 and the fist disbursement took place on April 28, 2018.   The borrower was to use the proceeds from these loans to partially finance an EPC contract with China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China Railway Group. The purpose of the project is to construct a 13 km light rail \\u2014 that travels at 80 km per hour \\u2014 in the capital city of Hanoi that passes through 12 stations: Cat Linh, La Thanh, Thai Ha, Lang, Thuong Dinh, Vanh Dai 3, Phung Khoang, Van Quan, Ha Dong, La Khe, Van Khe, Yen Nghia. The project officially commenced on October 10, 2011 and the new railway line was originally scheduled to launch in June 2015, but the completion date of the project has been postponed at least four times.  The project has encountered multiple problems and delays during implementation. In 2013, the project faced difficulties related to demolition and relocation, including the fact that the terrain was ideal for machinery and the construction site was close to traffic. Then, in 2014, the total cost of the project increased from $552.86 million to $868.04 million, forcing the Government of Vietnam to contract a supplementary loan from China Eximbank (see Project #63214).  In January 2015, the project faced major criticism from the Vietnamese government for multiple accidents during construction. Vietnamese officials and experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the project\\u2019s safety, with several accidents killing or injuring workers and passersby. In early 2016, Vietnam\\u2019s Ministry of Transport and China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd agreed on a new launch date in December 2016, before correcting themselves that the line would not be launched until early 2017. In February 2017, the railway line\\u2019s completion was postponed for another year, with a new launch set for February 2018.  In February 2017, the first set of trains (out of 13 total) was installed on the track . Each train is worth $63.2 million, and manufactured by China's Beijing Subway Rolling Stock Equipment Ltd. In 2018, the project manager submitted a proposal for the railway line to begin a test run in September 2018, setting the date for an official launch to be in 2021. On September 20, 2018, the first stage of a trial run was initiated, which was meant to last 3-6 months. The project is currently slated for completion on April 30, 2021. More than 600 people were reportedly hired to support the implementation of this project. Photos were taken on November 6th 2021 as the first commercial operation to the railway commenced, marking the completion of the project.\",\"On May 15, 2017, the Export-Import Bank of China and JSC KazAutoZhol National Company Joint Stock Company (JSC NC KazAutoZhol or \\u0430\\u0437\\u0410\\u0432\\u0442\\u043e\\u0416\\u043e\\u043b)\\u2014 a Kazakh state-owned transportation company \\u2014 signed a $253.3 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the 262 km Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 5-year grace period,. and a 20-year maturity. The Government of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $297 million commercial (EPC) contract between China Xinxing Construction\\u00a0and\\u00a0Development Co.\\u00a0Ltd\\u00a0(Xinxing\\u00a0Construction) and KazAutoZhol.   The purpose of the project was to reconstruct the Merke-Burylbaytal highway (MB266) in 4 sections measuring 262 km in length, The first (86 km), four-lane section runs from Merke to Shu. The 3 remaining, two-lane sections (measuring 176 km in length) run from the town of Shu to the village of Burybaytal. The highway passes through the settlements of Tatti, Shu, and Birlik. The project includes the construction of six bridges, three overpasses over rail lines, 11 illuminated traffic intersections, 276 culverts, recreation areas, and auto pavilions. Xinxing\\u00a0Construction is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, China General Technology Group (Genertec)\\u00a0is also involved in implementation.   A groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 26, 2019. The project was originally expected to reach completion in June 2022. However, it has encountered various implementation problems, including the COVID-19 pandemic. \",\"In 2006, China Eximbank and the Government of Equatorial Guinea signed a $2 billion oil-backed buyer\\u2019s credit facility agreement for various infrastructure projects (captured in Project ID#484). All subsidiary loans approved under this facility agreement carry the following terms: a 5.5% interest rate, 5 year maturity, and 2 year grace period.  Then, in 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Equatorial Guinea signed a $261 million subsidiary buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the 88.6 km Micameseng-Bongora Road Reconstruction Project.  The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed in September 2015.

This is an independent power project (IPP) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).  In August 2016, Pakistan\\u2019s Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB) awarded TNPTL a letter of intent (LOI) for the Phase 2 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 2) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. Then, in December 2016, PPIB issued a Letter of Support (LOS) to TNPTL, which was late amended in August 2017. It required TNPTL to achieve Financial Close (FC) for the project and enter an Implementation Agreement (IA), Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), Water Use Agreement, Coal Supply Agreement, and Land Lease Deed. TNPTL executed an Implementation Agreement with PPIB in November 2017 and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Pakistan\\u2019s Central Power Purchase Authority (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G) \\u2014 the power plant\\u2019s off-taker \\u2014 in July 2017.  It also signed a Water Use Agreement with Government of Sindh, a Coal Supply Agreement with Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company Limited (SECMC), and a Land Lease Deed for the purchase of 244 acres of land.   On April 27, 2019, a consortium of banks and TNPTL signed two syndicated loan agreements worth USD 373 million for Phase 2 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 2) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project: 1) a USD-denominated syndicated export buyer's credit loan facility agreement with China Development Bank (CDB), China Minsheng Bank, China Zheshang Bank; and 2) a PKR-denominated loan facility with Habib Bank Limited, the lead arranger for local financing, and other Pakistani banks. CDB, the lead arranger for foreign financing, contributed USD 262 million to the USD-denominated syndicated loan facility. The estimated borrowing terms of this foreign loan facility are as follows: a 10-year maturity, a 3.33-year grace period, an interest rate of 4.95%, and a 5% Sinosure insurance premium. Additionally, as a source of security (collateral) for the syndicated loan from CDB, China Minsheng Bank, and China Zheshang Bank, the owners of TNPTL pledged their shares (equity stakes) in the project company.  The total cost of Phase 2 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 2) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project is USD 497 million and it is financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Therefore, the remaining project cost (USD 124 million) was provided by the project sponsors \\u2014 HUBCO, Thal Limited, Novatex, CMEC, and Descon Engineering Limited \\u2014 via equity infusions. On July 22, 2019, TNPTL executed additional financing documents with its foreign and local lenders. Then, on September 30, 2020, the project achieved financial closure. The proceeds of the loans were to be used by the borrower to finance an Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) contract between TNPTL and CMEC, which was signed on April 10, 2017.    The purpose of Phase 2 was to construct a 330MW mine-mouth lignite-fired power plant in the energy park within Thar Block-II in Sindh Province. CMEC was one of the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. TNPTL gave Limited Notice to Proceed (LNTP) to its EPC Contractors on March 12, 2019. However, construction did not begin until May 2019. The originally expected Commercial Operations Date (COD) was March 31, 2021. However, on January 31, 2020, CMEC notified TNPTL of a Force Majeure Event (FME) due to outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID\\u201319) in China and across the globe. The expected COD for Phase 2 was revised to January 12, 2022. By the end of 2020, Phase 2 had only achieved a 34% completion rate. As of July 2022, the progress rate had reached 51%.

Approximately 15 months later, in December 2020, a Financial Advisor to Iraq\\u2019s Prime Minister, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih, told the Iraqi News Agency (INA), that Iraq\\u2019s House of Representatives would need to identify the specific projects to be funded under the framework agreement and allocate funds for these projects in the Federal Budget Law. He also signaled at the time that the Iraqi Government planned to borrow through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure to fund the construction of school buildings. Then, in June 2021, he announced that the 2021 Federal Budget Law included $2 billion for projects to be financed through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure, which had entered into force. 5 months later, in November 2021, he told a local newspaper that several Chinese companies had deposited $1.8 billion in an account and the funds would be used to support the construction of 1,000 schools as well as \\u2018infrastructure and renewable power projects\\u2019. This announcement implies that the Government of Iraq ultimately decided to borrowed via commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier\\u2019s credits) with Chinese companies rather than buyer\\u2019s credit facilities with PRC banks. On June 30, 2022, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih said that \\u2018[t]he operations of depositing money and withdrawing from the [escrow] account are continuing for the benefit of the projects concluded within the [export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure].\\u2019 He also noted that \\u2018the [escrow] account is managed very carefully by the Central Bank of Iraq, and the financial operations are audited by the major international financial auditing companies.\\u2019  There are three known projects \\u2014 supported by four separate commercial contracts \\u2014 that are being financed under the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure: the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project, the Construction of 1000 Schools Project, and the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project.  On June 8, 2021, the Government of Iraq and China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) signed a $367 million commercial (EPC) contract for the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project. The estimated monetary value of the supplier\\u2019s credit for the project is $311.95 million (as captured via Project ID#95985). The Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project involves (a) the expansion and renovation of an international airport (with a 5000 square meters freight building) in the town of Nasiriyah that, upon completion, will have the capacity the handle 750,000 travelers a year; and (b) the construction of a 25 kilometers long road linking the airport and the Dhi Qar governorate center. The airport served as an Iraqi Air Force base (also known as Talil Air Base) until 2011, after which it served U.S. forces as the Imam Ali Air Base until March 2017. CSCEC is the contractor responsible for project implementation.

However, it is known that the borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $336,386,821.80 commercial contract between the Government of Cote d'Ivoire and SinoHydro 5th Bureau, which was signed in November 2017. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire is also responsible for directly financing 15% ($50,458,023.27) of the commercial contract cost.   According to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire's Aid Management Platform (AMP), the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 52.7% disbursement rate (CFA 90,460,393,884.86 out of CFA 171,557,279,118) as of December 31, 2022. 6 China Eximbank loan disbursements (worth CFA 90,460,393,884.86) were made between 2021 and 2022: a CFA 28,025,899,865 disbursement on July 31, 2021, and a CFA 15,963,581,178.86 disbursement on December 31, 2021, a CFA 14,016,023,361 disbursement on March 31, 2022, a CFA 6,297,699,749 disbursement on June 30, 2022, a CFA 12,963,496,194 disbursement on August 31, 2022, and a CFA 13,193,693,537 on December 31, 2022.       The purpose of the project is to construct a 112.3 MW hydroelectric power plant in Gribo Popoli on the Sassandra River (downstream from Buyo dam site and the Soubr\\u00e9 dam site) and 10 km of transmission lines. The project also has a \\u2018project management\\u2019 component, involving an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), a Resettlement Action Plant (RAP) and an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 580 gigawatt hours of electricity output.   SinoHydro 5th Bureau is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 2, 2017. However, construction of the access road to the project site did not begin until January 2018. Several months later, in March 2018, construction of the diversion cofferdam and site facilities commenced. The ESIA was launched in May 2018, and the first compensation payments to displaced households were also made during calendar year 2018. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire issued an advance payment to SinoHydro 5th Bureau in May 2020. However, it was not until October 11, 2021 that the construction team began to assemble the power plant and the dam. Construction of the power plant and the dam began on October 27, 2021.   Project implementation is running behind schedule. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 40 months (estimated end date: May 2021). According to the Government of C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the borrowing institution was delayed in its (advance) payment of $50,458,023.27 to the EPC contractor. Another source of delay was the Government of C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire\\u2019s request (through the Ministry of Finance and Economy or MEF) for an amendment whereby the lender would provide disbursements in proportion to the project\\u2019s completion rate (progress).\",\"In November 2018, an unspecified Chinese state-owned bank and Karaj Urban and Suburban Railway Organisation (KUASRO) \\u2014 an Iranian state-owned company \\u2014 signed an RMB 1,950,000,000 loan agreement for Phase 1 of the Karaj Metro Line 2 Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance a $420 million commercial (EPC) contract with CITIC Group Corporation Ltd. The purpose of this project is to construct the first 15 km of Line 2 of the Karaj Metro, which upon completion will have a total length of 27 km. The 15 km stretch runs from Khwarazmi University Square in the west of Karaj to Shahid Soltani Square in the east of Karaj. CITIC Group Corporation Ltd. is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. As of September 2017, the project had achieved a 32.31% physical completion rate. By April 2021, the 15 km stretch between Khwarazmi University Square and Shahid Soltani Square had been fully excavated. However, international sanctions eventually slowed the project implementation efforts of CITIC Group Corporation Ltd., which led to litigation with the project owner (KUASRO). The project was originally expected to reach completion within 4 years of the start date of the EPC contract. However, the project has underperformed vis-a-vis the original objectives identified in the EPC contract.\",\"In November 2010, Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) began looking for sponsors to support the construction of a 2x660 MW supercritical coal-fired power plant \\u2014 known as the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant \\u2014 in Paschim Gandamara within Banskhali Upzila and Chittagong Division. Then, on December 19, 2013, S. Alam Group \\u2014 a Bangladeshi company that is active in the commodity trade, banking, insurance, and transportation sector \\u2014 signed a deal with Shangdong Electric Power Corporation III (SEPCO III), a subsidiary of China Power Construction Co. (PowerChina), to set-up a joint venture company to finance, design, construct, and operate the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant. The special purpose vehicle that was established, SS Power I Limited, is jointly owned by S. Alam Group (70% equity stake), SEPCO III Electric Power Construction Corporation (20% equity stake), and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. (10% equity stake).  The $2.506 billion Banskhali Power Plant is an independent power project (IPP) that was implemented on a build, own, and operate (BOO) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 71.1:28.9. On December 28, 2018, a syndicate of banks \\u2014 including Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as an arranger, lender, and original hedging bank, Bank of China Limited (Singapore Branch) as a lender, facility agent, offshore security agent, and offshore account bank, China Development Bank (CDB) as an arranger and lender, China Construction Bank (Shandong Branch) as an arranger, lender, original hedging bank, Agricultural Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, China Minsheng Bank (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, and Rupali Bank Limited as a lender, onshore security agent, and onshore account bank \\u2014 signed a $1.782 billion USD syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit agreement with SS Power I Limited for the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant Project. The buyer\\u2019s credit carried a 15-year maturity and an unknown interest rate. It was also supported by a Sinosure credit insurance policy and secured by (collateralized against) a share pledge, account pledge, a mortgage and debenture. AidData estimates that Bank of China contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#52792), CCB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98804), CDB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98814), and that ABC also contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98815).  The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance (a) 85% of the cost a $1.86 billion commercial (EPC) contract between S. Alam Group and SEPCO III, which was signed on June 29, 2015; and (b) 85% of the cost of the Sinosure premium and interest during construction under the senior buyer\\u2019s credit facility. The syndicated loan covered 71.1% of the total project cost. S. Alam Group, SEPCO III, and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. were expected to cover the remaining 28.9% via equity contributions. Project ID#52792 captures the debt financing for the project, while Project ID#54275 captures the equity financing for the project.  The purpose of the project was to construct a supercritical coal-fired power plant \\u2014 with two 660 MW supercritical power generation units \\u2014 and a new special coal unloading wharf in Paschim Gandamara within Banskhali Upzila and Chittagong Division (exact locational coordinates: 21.970844, 91.888932). The IPP is governed by the terms of an Implementation Agreement (IA) and a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) executed with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).  SEPCO III is the general engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several other contractors are also involved in the project. Dongfang Electric Corporation is responsible for providing the turbine generators, while Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Co., Ltd. is responsible for providing the boiler equipment. Sinohydro Foundation Engineering Co., Ltd. is also involved in project implementation. A formal project unveiling ceremony took place on October 14, 2016, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina laying the plant's foundation. However, project implementation did not begin until significantly later. A notice to proceed (NTP) was issued to the EPC contractor on December 10, 2018, and project implementation commenced on December 31, 2018. As stipulated in the EPC contract, the project completion date was scheduled to fall between 39 and 40 months (March 31, 2022 or April 30, 2022) after the EPC commencement date and the NTP date.  The construction of the Banskhali Power Plant has been the source of significant, often violent, controversy in Bangladesh. Villagers opposed to the plant began peaceful protests during the S. Alam Group's land acquisition efforts, decrying the displacement because of the plant's construction. Then, on April 4, 2016, 500 villagers gathered on the grounds of Gondamara School to protest against the construction of the plant, despite local authorities having banned the demonstration. The demonstration turned violent, as police opened fire, killing four protesters and wounding 30 more. Then, in early February 2017, at a community meeting in Abhaittya Ghona in Banskhali, sponsored by the Bangladesh Navy, the S. Alam Group, and local authorities, clashes broke out between pro and anti-plant factions (which were composed of followers of a local Awami League leader and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader, respectively) that led to the death of a pro-plant man and injured 16 more. After the clashes, the Bangladesh Navy began to supervise the project site's security along the local police.  In July 2020, the sponsors of the project were fined \\u09f32,000,000,000 BDT for delays in the construction works and received a two-year extension to the project period. Then, on April 17, 2021, clashes erupted between the Banskhali police and construction workers at the plant, supported by local people. The workers had been protesting over unpaid wages. The resulting altercation saw the police kill five workers and critically wound a dozen more. During the protest, workers committed arson and vandalism in the construction period. Two more workers died of their injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The next month, on May 28, 2021, police arrested a local Bangladeshi engineer for posting an anti-power plant message on Facebook under Bangladesh's Digital Security Act.  One cause of the resistance to the power plant is allegations from local residents near the power plant that the S. Alam Group bought their land to construct a garment factory to increase local employment, not a polluting power plant. The resistance was reportedly so strong that the S. Alam Group was willing to shift the entire plant to Chokoria if it could not convince the locals to support the plant. Another cause of protests was the environmental impact of the plant. An analysis of the air quality segment of the project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association and the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt, found that the EIA was filled with false information and omitted key details, in violation of the laws of Bangladesh. For example, the EIA failed to discuss the health impacts of the plant or mercy pollution, and falsely claimed that the air quality in Banskhali met Bangladeshi standards. The conclusions of the review suggested that the low-quality of the EIA was either the result of gross incompetence or deliberate manipulation. In a June 2021 letter to China's Commerce Minister, 129 activists and 79 organizations from 21 countries, including a number of well-known Bangladeshi figures, asked the Chinese Government to withdraw financing and technical support from the Banskhali Power Plant Project based on the project's lack of transparency, violations of human rights, and environmental damage.\",\"On July 29, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed a $3 billion oil-backed master framework agreement (or line of credit) to finance various infrastructure projects (see Umbrella Project ID#57039). This resources-credit cooperation package is backed by future revenues from the sale of oil exports. Each subsidiary buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) issued through the framework agreement carries a 15-year maturity and 5.6% interest rate.  On April 4, 2010, China Eximbank reportedly agreed in principle to finance a $274 million South Kordofan 220kV Power Transmission and Distribution Project through this non-concessional master framework agreement. However, on October 8, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed a $233 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for this project, which carried a different set of concessional borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity and 3% interest rate. The proceeds from this PBC were used to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $274 million commercial contract between China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) and the National Electricity Corporation (NEC) of Sudan, which was signed on July 4, 2009.  The project involved the construction of an electricity transmission line than runs from the city of El-Obeid (in central Sudan within North Kordofan State) to a power plant in Al-Fulah (or al-Fula or EI Fula or \\u0627\\u0644\\u0641\\u0648\\u0644\\u0629) in West Kordofan State. The 405 MW Al-Fulah Gas-Fired Power Plant Construction Project was funded through a separate China Eximbank BCL (as captured via Project ID#1007). The ultimate goal was to supply power to Northern and Southern Kordofan and the western region of Darfur.   This project did reach the implementation phase, but it is unclear whether or when the project was completed.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the South Kordofan 220kV Power Transmission and Distribution Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. According to Sudan\\u2019s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022.\",\"On October 28, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a $298,880,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO (2018) TOTAL NO 480] for the Kinsuka 220KV Substation and Associated Distribution Networks Project (captured via Project ID#59085). The PBC (loan) carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, and a 0.75% commitment fee. The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $52,743,617.40 in 2021 and 2022.    The purpose of the project is to evacuate power from the 150MW Zongo II Hydroelectric Dam, which was financed through a separate China Eximbank PBC (captured via Project ID#460).  The project involves the construction of the 220KV substation in Kinsuka commune and associated medium and low voltage distribution networks in the west of Kinshasa (in the municipalities of Mont Ngafula  and Ngaliema).   Shanghai Electric Group is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Taichang Electric and Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Nationale d\\u2019Electricit\\u00e9 (SNEL) are also involved in project implementation.  A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 27, 2021. However, construction reportedly began several months earlier in April 2021. By May 2023, the project was nearing completion and China's Ambassador to the DRC announced that Kinsuka substation would transmit power to nearly two million residents in the capital Kinshasa (approximately 6 months before DRC President Tshisekedi would stand for re-election).\",\"In April 2019, Minera Los Pelambres \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of Antofagasta Minerals, which is itself a joint venture of Antofagasta PLC (60% ownership stake), JX Nippon Mining & Metals (15.79% ownership stake), Marubeni Corporation (9.21% ownership stake), Mitsubishi Materials Corporation (10% ownership stake), and Mitsubishi Corporation (5% ownership stake)  \\u2014 signed a $1.3 billion loan agreement for the Los Pelambres Copper Mine Complementary Infrastructure Project. The loan had two tranches: a $425 million tranche (with a 10-year maturity) from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and an $875 million tranche (with a 7-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 120 basis points) supported by Mizuho Bank, Export Development Canada, Scotiabank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), the Chile Branch of Bank of China, and the Grand Cayman Branch of Bank of China. The Los Pelambres copper mine in Coquimbo region of Chile is currently being expanded in two phases. The mine has been operating since 2000 and currently produces copper concentrates containing gold and silver and a separate molybdenum concentrate. The $1.8bn expansion project, approved in November 2018, is expected to add an average of 60,000t of copper a year to the mine\\u2019s production over the first 15 years of operation. Environment impact assessment (EIA) for the expansion project was approved in February 2018.   Construction is expected to start in early-2019, while production from the first phase is anticipated to start in the second half of 2021. Copper production from the second phase is anticipated to start in 2022. Minera Los Pelambres, a contractual mining company owned and managed by Antofagasta Minerals, is the project developer. Antofagasta holds 60% interest in the project through Antofagasta Minerals, while the remaining stake is held by a Japanese consortium comprising JX Nippon and Mitsubishi Materials, Marubeni, Mitsubishi Corp, and Mitsui & Co.   Los Pelambres is located approximately 45km east from the city of Salamanca and 200km north of Santiago, Coquimbo, Chile. The two-phased expansion project will include the addition of a new semi-autogenous (SAG) mill, ball mill, and corresponding flotation circuit with 24 additional cells. The first phase, referred to as complementary infrastructure project (INCO), is focused on optimizing the production and eliminating the risks arising from the current operating and environmental permits. A new grinding line and a new flotation line will be installed at the existing Piuquenes plant to increase the ore processing capacity from 175,000 tpd to 190,000 tpd. The new additions are expected to increase the company\\u2019s fine copper production by 60,000 tpa from the second half of 2021. A reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant, with a processing capacity of up to 400 liters per second of industrial water, is also proposed to be constructed adjacent to the Punta Chungo port in Los Vilos. The desalinated water will be transported to the existing water recirculation facilities near the El Mauro tailings dam through a 61km-long buried pipeline. The first phase is estimated to involve a capital expenditure of approximately $1.3 billion, of which $600m is allocated for strengthening the milling and flotation. The remaining amount is allocated for the desalination plant and the water impulsion system. The second phase of expansion is expected to increase copper production from the mine by 35,000t a year. A new environmental impact assessment (EIA) will also be undertaken to increase the capacity of El Mauro tailings storage facility and create new mine waste dumps. Estimated to cost approximately $500m, the second phase will include additional mining equipment for increasing the crushing and grinding capacity, and flotation cells.   Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia (FCAB) is providing rail and truck services at the copper mine, while Antofagasta Terminal Internacional (ATI) is responsible for the port operations. HighService Engineering and Construction (HSIC) is conducting industrial assembly work, mainly mechanics and structure, at the project. Bechtel built the original copper concentrator at the Los Pelambres mine, which was followed by installation of a $40m pebble crusher in 2001 and additional conveying, grinding, and flotation equipment. It also participated in the Repower II expansion project, which increased the concentrator's capacity by 20% from 132,000 to 159,000 metric tons a day. Bechtel subcontracted CiDRA Minerals Processing for the supply of SONARtrac\\u00ae process monitoring systems to Minera Los Pelambres.\",\"On May 20, 2014, China Exim Bank and VEB-Leasing, a subsidiary of Vnesheconombank (VEB) signed an agreement for a $300 million buyer's credit line. The credit line is planned to finance the purchase of Chinese-made products in the field of industrial equipment, transport, infrastructure, high tech and innovative products, machine-building devices, and electronic devices.   On the same day, China Exim Bank and VEB(the parent company) signed another agreement for $500 million (see project ID#66466). Both of these agreements will go to developing the coal fields in the Far East.\",\"On June 3, 2013, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Costa Rica signed two financing agreements worth $396 million for the Rehabilitation and Extension of National Route N\\u00b0 32 Cross Section Route 4-Lim\\u00f3n. The Costa Rican Government approved these financing agreements on March 10, 2015 through Law N\\u00b0 9293.  The first agreement is a USD-denominated buyer's credit loan (ID# 1420202052013211015) worth $296 million (captured via Project ID#37364). The buyer's credit loan (BCL) carries the following borrowing terms: a 4% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a maturity of 20 years, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.  The second financing agreement is a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2013) 30 TOTAL NO. (475) 1420203052013111013] worth RMB 628 million (as captured via Project ID #39847). The GCL carries the following terms: an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a maturity of 20 years, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and BCL to finance 85% of the cost of a $465,593,387.06 commercial (EPC) contract [CONAVI-CHEC-00] between Costa Rica's National Road Council [Consejo Nacional de Vialidad] (CONAVI) and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC), which was signed on June 3, 2013.  The purpose of the project is to expand a 107-kilometer section of National Route 32 from two to four lanes. This road section begins at the Route 4 junction at Fr\\u00edo river and extends to Puerto Lim\\u00f3n\\u2019s district center. National Route 32 connects San Jos\\u00e9 with the port of Lim\\u00f3n. 80% of Costa Rican exports and imports go through the ports of Mo\\u00edn and Lim\\u00f3n, as it is the main connection with the ports of the eastern United States, Europe, and South America.   CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. CONAVI issued an order to CHEC to commence work on November 20, 2017.  The project was originally expected to take 42 months from the start date. However, it has faced a variety of delays related to land expropriation, tree cutting and clearing activities, environmental challenges, relocation of utilities, archaeological studies at five locations, and also cultural and language barriers. The initial planned completion date was October 4, 2020. However, according to Service order (O.S.-7) issued by CONAVI to CHEC on January 6, 2020, indicating that the new deadline for completion of the project was March 27, 2021. Another service order (O.S.-11) issued by CONAVI on February 25 2021, indicated that the new deadline for completion of the project was May 22, 2022. As of March 2019, the project had achieved a 9% completion rate. \",\"In 2010, the China Eximbank and State Grid Brazil Holding S.A. signed a $240,000,000 loan agreement for unspecified purposes.

The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to improve 3G and 4G service and modernize existing infrastructure. \",\"On November 26, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a $301,098,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the N\\u2019djili Airport Terminal Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.75% commitment fee. The loan is reportedly secured by (collateralized against) revenues that will be generated by an airport tax (called \\u201cGoPass\\u201d). The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $354,680,000 commercial (EPC) contract between R\\u00e9gie des Voies A\\u00e9riennes de la R\\u00e9publique D\\u00e9mocratique du Congo) (RVA) and Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative Co., Ltd. (WIETEC), which was signed on September 16, 2013.     The purpose of the project is to construct a new airport terminal \\u2014 with an area of \\u200b\\u200b40,617 m2 including a ground floor for arrivals \\u2014 at N'djili International Airport in Kinshasa. The project also involves the installation of check-in counters, arrival and departure baggage rooms, public areas, shopping centers, a foundation, and a parking lot (with the ability to accommodate 1200 vehicles). WIETEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.     A foundation-laying ceremony took place on May 2, 2018. As of May 2020, the DRC\\u2019s Minister of Transport Didier Mazengu Mukanzu reported to Parliament that the project\\u2019s technical and topographical studies and feasibility studies were 80% complete. By September 2020, the project design process was complete and implementation was expected to start by the end of 2020. As of December 2020, all of the necessary materials and equipment were on-site to begin construction but project implementation had stalled due to the fact that the Congolese Government had not met its counterpart funding commitment. China Eximbank was also withholding loan disbursements. In August 2021, Alphonse Shungu, the Director General of the RVA, reported that the project had only achieved a 9.21% completion rate.   Then, in 2021 and 2021, Qatar Airways Group (QAG) reportedly prepared a major contract for the renovation and management of three strategic airports in the DRC: N'djili International Airport, Ndolo Airport and Lubumbashi Airport. The feasibility studies were entrusted to the Dutch company NACO, which specializes in airport infrastructure. The two parties, who signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2021, agreed on a public-private partnership (PPP) under which QAG would shoulder the cost of renovating and updating the three airports on its own, in exchange for managing it for an unspecified length of time (perhaps as long as thirty years). Under these terms, RVA would no longer manage these airports, depriving it of the bulk of its revenues, especially of the highly controversial \\u2018go-pass\\u2019 tax that travelers have to pay.   Also, as of September 2022, the Congolese Government was reportedly looking to end its partnership with Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative (WIETC) for the construction of the new N'djili airport.\",\"On July 6, 2004, JSC KazTransOil (KTO) \\u2014 a state-owned oil pipeline operator in Kazakhstan \\u2014 and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) created a special purpose vehicle called Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP (KCP or \\u049a\\u0430\\u0437\\u0430\\u049b\\u0441\\u0442\\u0430\\u043d-\\u049a\\u044b\\u0442\\u0430\\u0439 \\u049a\\u04b1\\u0431\\u044b\\u0440\\u044b \\u0416\\u0428\\u0421 or \\u4e2d\\u54c8\\u7ba1\\u9053\\u6709\\u9650\\u8d23\\u4efb\\u516c\\u53f8). KCP, which is jointly owned by KTO (50% equity stake) and CNODC (50% equity stake), was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou Pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol Pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. To finance the 965 km Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, CNODC and KTO contributed $50 million of their own funds (as captured by linked project ID#39605). In addition, $600 million was raised through the issuing of Eurobonds by JP Morgan Bank.   Then, in August 2013, KCP entered into a $300 million facility agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Almaty) JSC (ICBC Almaty) to refinance obligations on bonds issued to finance the construction of the Atasu-Alashankou Section of Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project. This loan has a 10-year maturity (final maturity: 2023) and it bears interest at a rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.75% margin per annum. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $180 million (\\u20b859.8 billion KZT). KCP is expected to repay borrowing funds using profit (net income).   The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan. All three systems are operational.   The original joint venture financing of the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline project is captured via Project ID#39605. \",\"In June 2014, the Chinese Minister of Commerce and Zambian Minister of Finance signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) Airport Expansion Project. Then, on June 15, 2014, Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao and Zambian Vice President Guy Scott witnessed the signing of two Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ETCA). One committed a $32 million grant (captured via Project ID#40890) and the other committed $32 million interest-free loan (captured via Project ID#40889). Some of the funds from one or both of these ETCAs helped finance the KKIA Airport Expansion Project.  Then, on September 16, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance and National Planning signed two loan agreements for the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) Airport Expansion Project: a $306,000,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) and a $54,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement. The PBC, captured via Project ID#40893, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The GCL, captured via Project ID#92156, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.   The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $385,000,000 (or $385,809,673) commercial contract between the Government of Zambia and China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Cooperation, which was signed on June 3, 2013 and amended on September 5, 2013. As of July 2022, the PBC had achieved a 74.7% disbursement rate ($228,810,000 out of $306,000,000).  The project involves the expansion of Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in Lusaka (exact locational coordinates: -15.325266732091906, 28.448490127571315). More specifically, the project involves the construction of a new presidential pavilion, passenger terminal, commercial complex, airport shopping mall, office park, warehousing facilities, fire station, control tower, and hotel. It also included the rehabilitation of the existing terminal into a new one to carter for domestic flights.  China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation is the contractor responsible for design and works. The contract with Zambia Airports Corporation Ltd. (ZACL) came into force on March 10, 2015 and construction began on April 1, 2015.   The project was originally expected to commenced on April 21, 2015 and conclude on October 20, 2019. The expected project completion date was later revised to June 2020 and then March 10, 2022. As of July 31, 2020, the project had achieved an 89% completion rate. As of April 30, 2021, the project had achieved a 93% completion rate. As of June 30, 2021, $271,900,000 had been paid to CJIC (representing 75.53% of the EPC contract value). As of August 31, 2021, the new airport terminal building had been handed over and commissioned, but, the following works were outstanding: bullet-proofing and finishing on the presidential pavilion (89% completion rate); steel structure installation on the corridor connecting the terminals (35% completion rate); a widening of the taxiway shoulder (98% completion rate); a rehabilitation of the existing terminal building (5% completion rate); and a rehabilitation of ZASTI (10% completion rate). A formal airport opening ceremony took place on August 9, 2021.   This project has been plagued by corruption allegations and performance problems. In April 2015, media outlets reported that Zambian government officials and CJIC stole $25 million from the China Eximbank loan by unilaterally changing the original contract from $385 million to $360 million. This corruption allegation and contract renegotiations delayed project implementation by a few years. Then, in October 2019, China Eximbank reportedly halted loan disbursements due to concerns that the Government of Zambia would default on its repayment obligations.  On July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the PBC\\u2019s undisbursed balance ($77,190,000.00); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities\\u2019 request for a debt treatment under \\u2018the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI\\u2019 endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. MOFNP also announced on July 29, 2022 that it planned to finance the completion of the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) Airport Expansion Project with general government revenues, and it signaled its intention to rescope the project to focus on the construction of the old terminal building and the extension of the runway and lighting system.\",\"On June 9, 2014, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, visited China and the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Then, on November 14, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 1,950,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement and a $405.8 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The PBC carries the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Project ID#55046 captures the GCL, while Project ID#38342 captures the PBC. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh\\u2019s Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges and China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed in June 2015. The GCL had disbursed RMB 936,1890,000 as of June 30, 2018, RMB 1,557,869,000 as of June 30, 2019, RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, and RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2021. No repayments on the GCL had been made as of June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the PBC had disbursed $165.559 million and no repayments had been made.   The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Multilane Karnaphuli Tunnel Project, is to construct a 3.4-kilometer-long, 10-meter-wide tunnel under the Karnaphuli River near the Port of Chittagong. The total length of the proposed tunnel will be around 9.092 kilometers, including a 3.40-kilometer tunnel under the Karnaphuli River with an approach road of 4.89 kilometers alongside 740 meters of bridges linking the main port city, and western side of the Karnaphuli along with the eastern side of the river. Upon completion, the tunnel will connect the port of Chittagong to the industrial area of the city and thereby relieve pressure on the three existing bridges. The total area of the project is 382.03 acres. More than 360.64 acres of land were acquired for the construction of roads and installments of utility lines. A total of 2,275 families are affected by this project, and 1,660 were given compensation. China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) is the general (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation.   On November 24, 2015, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Construction began on February 24, 2017.    Two years later, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh officially inaugurated boring works on the tunnel on February 24, 2019. The project had achieved a 40% physical completion rate by May 2019, including the installation of over 150 meters of the first tunnel and much of the above-ground works. Then, on July 31, 2020, the project reached a key milestone with the completion of the first underwater, after a made-in-China super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance tunnel boring machine (TBM) broke through at the Karnaphuli River east bank working shaft.    The TBM, which is 94 meters long and weighs more than 2,200 tons, was developed by the Tianhe Mechanical Equipment Manufacturing Co. It was the first super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance TBM to be self-developed and exported by China. The TBM uses several self-developed technologies, such as an automatic mud water circulation system. As of October 2021, all boring-related work was completed \\u2014 after the excavation of the second tube (from Anwara end of Chittagong to Patenga end) of the 3.315-km tunnel) \\u2014 and the project had achieved a 73% physical completion rate. By November 2021, the project had achieved a 77.5% physical completion rate. On May 8, 2022, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA). In it, he noted that Shanghai Port had remained closed since March 2022 due to Covid-19 and the Chinese Government\\u2019s zero-tolerance policy had affected the project\\u2019s progress: \\u2018It may be noted that [\\u2026] most of the goods and equipment are being manufactured/procured from Shanghai. Therefore, the closure of the Shanghai Port is causing a delay in shipments. [\\u2026] The goods and equipment planned to arrive in March [2022] are still not able to reach Chittagong Port to date. Subsequent shipments will also get affected on this account.\\u2019 In the letter, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury also asked the BBA to take up the issue with the Economic Relations Division (ERD) and arrange an extension of the China Eximbank loan availability period by six months until May 6, 2023. On May 7, 2022, Li Zheng, the CCCC Project Manager of the Karnaphuli Tunnel Project Site Office, acknowledged in a letter to Harunur Rashid Chowdhury that the delay in shipments from Shanghai was the result of China\\u2019s \\u2018zero Covid\\u2019 measures. Then, in June 2022, BBA announced that two sub-contractors hired CCCC to complete two project components \\u2014 a management software system for BBA and the service area (east) \\u2014 had violated their contractual obligations. According to a letter from Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, to the BBA, \\u2018CCCC was instructed to undertake this work, but they employed sub-contractors to do so.  CCCC selected these sub-contractors and is responsible for any default of the sub-contractors. [\\u2026] Unfortunately, CCCC has not effectively monitored or exercised control over both these sub-contractors.\\u2019 The Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020. However, in 2018, the project\\u2019s expected completion date was pushed back to December 4, 2022.    Upon completion, the underwater tunnel is expected to reduce the time it takes to drive from Hittagong Shah Amanat International Airport to the Hittagong industrial park from four hours to 20 minutes.\",\"In August 2019, China Development Bank and the National Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan (NBU) signed a $309 million loan agreement to facilitate the acquisition of three Boeing 787-8 aircraft (\\u2018Dreamliners\\u2019) for Uzbekistan Airways. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 10-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.1% margin, and a 0.3% management fee. It was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) a mortgage on the three aircraft. The borrower on-lent the proceeds of the loan to Uzbekistan Airways.  According to NBU, the loan had achieved a disbursement rate of at least 65.4% by the end of calendar year 2020 ($202,193,933 out of $309,000,000). There is also some evidence that suggest at least one of the Boeing 787-8 aircraft was successfully delivered to Uzbekistan Airways.\",\"On August 1, 2018, We Soda \\u2014 a wholly owned subsidiary of the Ciner Group \\u2014 signed a $1,660,000,000 syndicated loan agreement with a group of banks.

Members of the international bank loan syndicate included joint mandated lead arrangers Mizuho Bank, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, DBS Bank, United Overseas Bank, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, Korea Development Bank, Shinsei Bank, and KfW Bank on a club basis. The total project debt amounted to US$3.745 billion, which was split into two syndicated tranches, this US$2.045 billion international bank offshore portion and a $100 million domestic Indonesian bank tranche, as well as two bilateral tranches of $1.2 billion (from JBIC) and $400 million (from the Asian Development Bank), respectively. The domestic bank tranche comprised four state-owned Indonesian banks PT. Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk., PT. Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk., PT. Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk., PT. Indonesia Infrastructure Finance.  The deal involved a complex multi-tranche Indonesian trustee borrowing structure (TBS). Under this structure, loans are repaid from an agreed portion of gross proceeds under identified offtake contracts, in this case the liquified natural gas (LNG) SPAs. The buyers make payments directly to the trustee and paying agent [HSBC USA (New York)]. The trustee is also the borrower under the loan agreement with the lenders, and the debt service payments are made from the trustee accounts. Except otherwise provided, the lenders look to this source of debt service for all loans, with no recourse to the project and no security interest in the project assets or contacts. The project\\u2019s trustee borrowing structure is innovative compared with other Indonesian trustee borrowing schemes for two reasons. First, the financing structure had to function independently from the schemes used to finance the original Tangguh LNG plant. In addition, the project\\u2019s trustee borrowing structure had to be structured to comply with the Bank Indonesia regulation No.16/10/PBI/2014 as amended by Bank Indonesia regulation No 17/23/PBI/2015 (PBI 16/10). Pursuant to PBI 16/10, all export proceeds and foreign exchange debt must be paid onshore into an account maintained with a bank in Indonesia. To ensure compliance with this regulation, the project\\u2019s TBS includes a parallel onshore trustee structure.   The purpose of the project is to add a third LNG process train (Train 3) and 3.8 million tons per annum (mtpa) of production capacity to the existing Tangguh LNG facility on the south side of Bintuni Bay in Teluk Bintuni Regency within Papua Barat Province, bringing the total capacity of the plant to 11.4 mtpa. The project also involves the construction of two offshore platforms, 13 new production wells, an expanded LNG loading facility, and supporting infrastructure. The project is expected to reach completion in July 2020 and play an important role in supporting Indonesia's growing energy demand, with 75% of the Train 3 annual LNG production sold to the Indonesian state electricity company PT. PLN (Persero). To address the needs of Papua Barat for electricity, Tangguh has also committed up to 20mmscfd of LNG for sale. The remaining volumes are under contract to Kansai Electric Power Company in Japan, the other foundation buyer for Train 3.   The Tangguh LNG facility is located in Teluk Bintuni Regency, Papua Barat Province of Indonesia and consists of offshore gas production facilities supplying two 3.8 mtpa liquefaction trains that have been in operation since 2009. It is operated by BP Berau Ltd on behalf of the other production sharing contract partners as contractor to SKK Migas. BP Berau Ltd and its affiliates in Indonesia hold a 37.16% interest in the project. Other Tangguh production sharing contract partners are MI Berau B.V. (16.30%), CNOOC Muturi Ltd. (13.90%), Nippon Oil Exploration (Berau), Ltd. (12.23%), KG Berau Petroleum Ltd and KG Wiriagar Petroleum Ltd (10.00%), Indonesia Natural Gas Resources Muturi Inc. (7.35%), and Talisman Wiriagar Overseas Ltd. (3.06%). In March 2020 Indonesia's upstream regulator the Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and Gas Business Activities (SKK Migas) announced that construction of the terminal's third train would be delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical distancing was established among workers at the site, leading to a decline from 13,000 workers to 10,000 workers in the third week of March 2020, with plans to reduce on-site workers further to a core group of 3,000. The 3.8-mtpa expansion to the 7.6-mtpa terminal was originally scheduled to be commissioned in Q3 2020 but was delayed to Q3 2021 because of two tsunamis in 2018. Bank of China also contributed to a syndicated loan in 2007 that financed the first two trains of the Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project (see Project ID#85359).\",\"On May 30, 2008, the Chinese Government and and the Government of Vietnam signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Cat Linh-Ha Dong Light Rail Construction Project. This subsequently produced three different loan agreements:  (1) On October 22, 2008, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.2 billion ($169 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.(14) Total No.(223)] for this railway project (see Project #73326). The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: 3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.  (2) On November 8, 2009, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed a $250 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No.2009 (24) Total No. (86)] for this railway project (Project #34616). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 4% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.  (3) On May 11, 2017, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.678 million ($250.62 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.2017 (24) Total No. (629)] for this railway project (see Project #63214). The loan terms are unknown. This GCL came into effect on December 28, 2017 and the fist disbursement took place on April 28, 2018.  The borrower was to use the proceeds from these loans to partially finance an EPC contract with China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China Railway Group. The purpose of the project is to construct a 13 km light rail \\u2014 that travels at 80 km per hour \\u2014 in the capital city of Hanoi that passes through 12 stations: Cat Linh, La Thanh, Thai Ha, Lang, Thuong Dinh, Vanh Dai 3, Phung Khoang, Van Quan, Ha Dong, La Khe, Van Khe, Yen Nghia. The project officially commenced on October 10, 2011 and the new railway line was originally scheduled to launch in June 2015, but the completion date of the project has been postponed at least four times.  The project has encountered multiple problems and delays during implementation. In 2013, the project faced difficulties related to demolition and relocation, including the fact that the terrain was ideal for machinery and the construction site was close to traffic. Then, in 2014, the total cost of the project increased from $552.86 million to $868.04 million, forcing the Government of Vietnam to contract a supplementary loan from China Eximbank (see Project #63214).  In January 2015, the project faced major criticism from the Vietnamese government for multiple accidents during construction. Vietnamese officials and experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the project\\u2019s safety, with several accidents killing or injuring workers and passersby. In early 2016, Vietnam\\u2019s Ministry of Transport and China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd agreed on a new launch date in December 2016, before correcting themselves that the line would not be launched until early 2017. In February 2017, the railway line\\u2019s completion was postponed for another year, with a new launch set for February 2018.  In February 2017, the first set of trains (out of 13 total) was installed on the track . Each train is worth $63.2 million, and manufactured by China's Beijing Subway Rolling Stock Equipment Ltd. In 2018, the project manager submitted a proposal for the railway line to begin a test run in September 2018, setting the date for an official launch to be in 2021. On September 20, 2018, the first stage of a trial run was initiated, which was meant to last 3-6 months. The project is currently slated for completion on April 30, 2021. Photos were taken on November 6th 2021 as the first commercial operation of the railway commenced.

The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019. The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China\\u2019s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasak\\u00f6y route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya.

The Odayeri-Pa\\u015fak\\u00f6y section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtk\\u00f6y-Akyaz\\u0131 section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (\\u201cConsortium Company\\u201d) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (\\u201cIC Maintenance\\u201d), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi. Shareholders of the Consortium Company expected to invest up to $688.5 million. As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company\\u2019s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC \\u0130\\u00e7ta\\u015f Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner. \",\"In 2009, China Development Bank provided a $300 million loan to Kazakhmys (a sister company of Kazakhtelecom JSC, which is also known as \\u201cKaztel\\u201d) under an agreement with its controlling shareholder, JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna. On November 14, 2009, Kazakhtelecom (or \\u201cKaztel\\u201d) issued a $300 million guarantee to China Development Bank for its loan to Kazakkmys under an agreement with its controlling shareholder, JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna. This guarantee would be triggered if JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna defaulted on its payments to China Development Bank.   JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna issued a cross-guarantee to Kaztel promising to pay it back any amounts that Kaztel would have to pay to China Development Bank. This cross-guarantee is from the same entity that benefits from Kaztel's guarantee and, according to Fitch Ratings, would  be of limited value if Kaztel's guarantee was triggered. This sizeable guarantee exposed Kaztel to the credit risks of its sister company (Kazakkmys). If triggered, the guarantee would result in liquidity pressure and a substantial debt and leverage increase. Fitch Ratings put out a press released a public statement on January 10, 2012, noting the poor disclosure of this liability and highlighting the inherent corporate governance and information transparency risks in Kaztel's credit profile (since the arrangements and the guarantee were disclosed in Kazakhmys's reporting but not in Kaztel's accounts).\",\"On June 3, 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a loan facility worth $300 million with Megafon for the purchase of Huawei products. The facility has an interest rate of LIBOR + 2.7%. The facility is repayable in semi-annual installments from 2011 to 2016. Megafon documents refer to the facility as \\\"China Development Bank III Credit Facility\\\". The loan was an export's credit. Sinosure provided insurance for the loan.  The equipment will help Megafon expand its 3G services as well as its GSM content. The loan is in the form of export credits. Sinosure is providing the insurance for the loan.  As of December 31, 2010, the facility had a drawn down amount of $218,182,000 USD. CDB has provided several loan facilities to MegaFon. See project ID #66854 for the first CDB credit facility to Megafon (CDB I), #66916 for CDB II, #66936 for CDB IV, #66953 for CDB V, #66939 for CDB VI, and #66954 for CDB VII.\",\"In October 2008, China Eximbank and Gazprombank \\u2014 a privately-owned Russian bank \\u2014 signed a $300 million loan framework agreement. Then, on June 17, 2009, China Eximbank and Gazprombank signed a buyer\\u2019s credit facility (loan) agreement worth approximately $300 million to facilitate the acquisition of Chinese drilling equipment. The loan had a maturity length of 7 years. Sinosure provided buyer\\u2019s credit insurance. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to purchase drilling equipment manufactured by Honghua International Co., Ltd. (a subsidiary of Sichuan Honghua Petroleum Equipment Co., Ltd.) and Yantai Jereh Oilfield Services Group Co., Ltd.  The equipment was intended for use in projects of the largest Russian and foreign oil and gas companies in Western and Eastern Siberia. It was envisaged that oilfield service company Eriell Neftegazservice LLC would operate the equipment. Russian manufacturers of drilling equipment opposed the deal . AidData has not yet confirmed that any disbursements were made through this loan. Nor has it confirmed the delivery of the drilling equipment.\",\"In 2007, China\\u2019s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wu Dawei visited North Korea and proposed constructing a new bridge over the Amrok [Yalu] River to replace the aging \\u2018Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge\\u2019. Then, in October 2009, Premier Wen Jiabao visited North Korea to make the deal official and the Chinese Government agreed to take on the bridge construction costs.  Then, on February 25, 2010, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea signed the Agreement between the Government of the People\\u2019s Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People\\u2019s Republic of Korea on Joint Construction, Management and Maintenance of the Yalu River Boundary Highway Bridge in Dandong City, Liaoning Province (\\u4e2d\\u671d\\u9e2d\\u7eff\\u6c5f\\u754c\\u6cb3\\u516c\\u8def\\u5927\\u6865 in Chinese). The initial estimated project cost was RMB 1.98 billion, but this figure later increased to RMB 2.22 billion.   The purpose of the project is to construct a new (river) road bridge across the Amnok River between Dandong, Liaoning Province, China, and Sinuiju, North Korea. The cable-stayed bridge, which is 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) long including the supporting roads, is intended as a replacement for the Sino\\u2013Korean Friendship Bridge. When the bridge is completed, the existing Amnok River Bridge (located approximately 10km away from the new bridge) will be restricted to railroad traffic only, and general road traffic to-and-from North Korea and China will be rerouted to the new bridge. The existing Amnok River Bridge (\\u2018Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge\\u2019) has been cited as a bottleneck for the blooming trade industry between North Korea and China for several reasons. The bridge, built in 1911, accommodates both a railway and roadway, but has only one lane. Furthermore, its old age has sparked safety concerns; trucks weighing over 20 tons have been prohibited from using the bridge.  CCCC Second Harbor Engineering Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 31, 2010 and main bridge closure was achieved in 2013. However, the project reportedly \\u2018stalled\\u2019 between 2014 and 2019. On October 31, 2014, the Chinese state-run Global Times media outlet reported that the North Korean Government had not honored its commitment to construct access roads to the bridge and as such, the project was indefinitely on hold. However, when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited North Korea in June 2019, he reportedly promised to bear the full cost of constructing roads and customs posts on the North Korean side of the bridge. Then, in September 2019, Kim Jong-un issued \\\"Order No. 1\\u201d, which called for the completion and opening of the bridge. By the end of the month, construction of access roads and customs posts on the North Korean side of the bridge began. Then, at the end of January 2020, North Korea blocked the border between China and North Korea and evacuated all construction personnel due to the spread of COVID-19. By April 2020 the project was reportedly nearing completion. However, in mid-August 2020, the project was stopped again. Then, in October 2020, project implementation re-commenced. As of March 2021, the bridge was expected to be put into operation during the second half of 2021. \",\"On July 1, 2005, China Development Bank and Vnesheconombank (VEB) \\u2014 a Russian state-owned bank \\u2014 signed a $212 million loan agreement for the pre-export activities of Russian companies and the production of various types of high-tech aviation equipment for eventual export to China. The loan has a 1-year grace period, a 3.5 year maturity, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1% margin. The loan was scheduled for repayment from June 2006 to March 2009.  CDB opened an additional 300 million USD credit line with VEB in November of the same year for similar purposes (see project ID #42966).\",\"On June 29, 2016, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO or \\u963f\\u66fc\\u77f3\\u6cb9\\u5f00\\u53d1\\u516c\\u53f8) \\u2014 an oil exploration and production company majority-owned by the Government of Oman \\u2014 signed a $4 billion syndicated pre-export finance (PXF) facility agreement with Bank of China (BOC), HSBC Bank, ING Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, JPMorgan, National Bank of Abu Dhabi, Natixis, Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale, Standard Chartered Bank and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The loan had a 5-year maturity, 2-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 160 basis points (1.6% margin). The borrower is responsible or repaying the loan with the proceeds of the sale of crude oil.   The proceeds from the $4 billion facility were to be used by PDO to finance the construction of major new oil and gas facilities. To organize the facility, PDO worked in cooperation with Oman\\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Oil and Gas. The facility was structured as a secured loan backed by future oil production revenues collected by an orphan special purpose vehicle based in the Netherlands, with the fund used as upfront payment to GSO for the delivery of crude oil volumes under a forward sales agreement. The deal was closed in record time \\u2013 about four weeks \\u2013 with banks from outside the region joining as final participants. This allowed PDO to upsize the facility from $3.4 billion to $4 billion.\",\"On June 9, 2014, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, visited China and the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Then, on November 14, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 1,950,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement and a $405.8 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The PBC carries the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Project ID#55046 captures the GCL, while Project ID#38342 captures the PBC. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh\\u2019s Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges and China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed in June 2015. The GCL had disbursed RMB 936,1890,000 as of June 30, 2018, RMB 1,557,869,000 as of June 30, 2019, RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, and RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2021. No repayments on the GCL had been made as of June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the PBC had disbursed $165.559 million and no repayments had been made.   The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Multilane Karnaphuli Tunnel Project, is to construct a 3.4-kilometer-long, 10 meter-wide tunnel under the Karnaphuli River near the Port of Chittagong. The total length of the proposed tunnel will be around 9.092 kilometers, including a 3.40-kilometer tunnel under the Karnaphuli River with an approach road of 4.89 kilometers alongside 740 meters of bridges linking the main port city, and western side of the Karnaphuli along with the eastern side of the river. Upon completion, the tunnel will connect the port of Chittagong to the industrial area of the city and thereby relieve pressure on the three existing bridges. The total area of the project is 382.03 acres. More than 360.64 acres of land were acquired for the construction of roads and installments of utility lines.  A total of 2,275 families are affected by this project, and 1,660 were given compensation. China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) is the general (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. On November 24, 2015, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Construction began on February 24, 2017.  Two years later, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh officially inaugurated boring works on the tunnel on February 24, 2019. The project had achieved a 40% physical completion rate by May 2019, including the installation of over 150 meters of the first tunnel and much of the above-ground works. Then, on July 31, 2020, the project reached a key milestone with the completion of the first underwater, after a made-in-China super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance tunnel boring machine (TBM) broke through at the Karnaphuli River east bank working shaft.    The TBM, which is 94 meters long and weighs more than 2,200 tons, was developed by the Tianhe Mechanical Equipment Manufacturing Co. It was the first super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance TBM to be self-developed and exported by China. The TBM uses several self-developed technologies, such as an automatic mud water circulation system. As of October 2021, all boring-related work was completed \\u2014 after the excavation of the second tube (from Anwara end of Chittagong to Patenga end) of the 3.315-km tunnel) \\u2014 and the project had achieved a 73% physical completion rate. By November 2021, the project had achieved a 77.5% physical completion rate. On May 8, 2022, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA). In it, he noted that Shanghai Port had remained closed since March 2022 due to Covid-19 and the Chinese Government\\u2019s zero-tolerance policy had affected project\\u2019s progress: \\u2018It may be noted that [\\u2026] most of the goods and equipment are being manufactured/procured from Shanghai. Therefore, the closure of the Shanghai Port is causing a delay in shipments. [\\u2026] The goods and equipment planned to arrive in March [2022] are still not able to reach Chittagong Port to date. Subsequent shipments will also get affected on this account.\\u2019 In the letter, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury also asked the BBA to take up the issue with the Economic Relations Division (ERD) and arrange an extension of the China Eximbank loan availability period by six months until May 6, 2023. On May 7, 2022, Li Zheng, the CCCC Project Manager of the Karnaphuli Tunnel Project Site Office, acknowledged in a letter to Harunur Rashid Chowdhury that the delay in shipments from Shanghai was the result of China\\u2019s \\u2018zero Covid\\u2019 measures. Then, in June 2022, BBA announced that two sub-contractors hired CCCC to complete two project components \\u2014 a management software system for BBA and the service area (east) \\u2014 had violated their contractual obligations. According to a letter from Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, to the BBA, \\u2018CCCC was instructed to undertake this work, but they employed sub-contractors to do so.  CCCC selected these sub-contractors and is responsible for any default of the sub-contractors. [\\u2026] Unfortunately, CCCC has not effectively monitored or exercised control over both these sub-contractors.\\u2019 The Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020. However, in 2018, the project\\u2019s expected completion date was pushed back to December 4, 2022.    Upon completion, the underwater tunnel is expected to reduce the time it takes to drive from Hittagong Shah Amanat International Airport to the Hittagong industrial park from four hours to 20 minutes.\",\"On September 6, 2018, the Government of the Republic of Serbia approved a $445 million preferential buyer's credit (loan) application to China Eximbank for the Preljina-Pozega Section of the Highway E-763 Construction Project. Then, on April 25, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Serbia signed a $445 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2019) 2 TOTAL NO.

As of December 2021, 127 km of roads had been covered with new asphalt concrete pavement.  Construction began in May 2019 and the project was originally expected to reach completion in June 2022. However, it has encountered several implementation problems, including the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in the cost of road construction materials, and contractor performance problems. In October 2021, Xinxing\\u00a0Construction completed one of the eight road sections (measuring 43.228 in length).\",\"In 2016, Formosa Ha Tinh (Cayman) Limited \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and subsidiary of the Taiwanese conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group that is registered in the Cayman Islands \\u2014 signed a $2.5 billion syndicated loan agreement with a group of Chinese and non-Chinese lenders for the Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Plant Construction Project. The loan consisted of a $1.5 billion, 7-year tranche that carried an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 1.58% margin and a $1 billion, 5-year tranche  that carried an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 1.4% margin. Known participants in the $1.5 billion tranche include Bank of Taiwan, DBS, Hua Nan Commercial Bank, Mega International Commercial Bank and Taipei Fubon Bank. Known participants in the $1 billion tranche include Bank of China, Mizuho and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. Bank of China reportedly contributed $425 million.    The purpose of the project was to construct the Ha Tinh Formosa Plastics Steel Complex in in K\\u1ef3 Ph\\u01b0\\u01a1ng commune, K\\u1ef3 Anh district, and H\\u00e0 T\\u0129nh province. A groundbreaking ceremony for the plant took place in December 2, 2012 in the presence of Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung. Then in late 2015, the plant outputted the first hot rolled coil manufactured in Vietnam. However, the project encountered a variety of problems and delays. On March 24, 2015, a 30-meter-high scaffolding section at the project site collapsed, killing 16 construction workers and injuring 27 others. Then, in June 2016, the complex was found to be discharging cyanide and other pollutants that killed fish along a 130-mile stretch of the Vietnamese coast. After a Vietnamese government report confirmed that Hung Nghiep Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Limited Company was responsible for the environmental damage, the company agreed to pay $500 million in compensation for discharging water containing chemicals such as phenol, cyanide and iron hydroxides. Then, on May 29, 2017, the plant restarted (and one of the blast furnaces was put into operation) after its operations were halted in the wake of the disaster. However, one day later (on May 30, 2017), a dust explosion rocked the Ha Tinh Formosa Plastics Steel Complex.\",\"In June 2012, Emba Elektrik \\u00dcretim applied to build a 1200 MW coal-fired power plant in Yumurtal\\u0131k district, where numerous other proposed coal-fired power plant projects are located. An environmental permitting meeting held in Sug\\u00f6z\\u00fc in September 2012 was met with protests from locals and environmentalists. There was no news on the project for several years, and it seemed possible that it had been abandoned. Along with numerous other proposals, the proposal was revived in 2014 as the 1,200-MW, two-unit Hunutlu plant. The project began the public comment period for environmental permitting in June 2014. In 2015, the land was expropriated, with the price being set at 100 lira per square meter. The Turkish Energy Market Regulation Authority (EPDK) finally permitted the project construction and issued a 49-year generation license on July 9, 2015. Then, on June 29, 2016, Adana Bar, Turkish Bar Associations, Medical Chamber of Adana, Agriculture and Engineers Chamber of Adana and Do\\u011fu Akdeniz \\u00c7evre Dernekleri (East Mediterranean Environment Associations)\\u00a0filed a lawsuit\\u00a0against seven coal-fired power plant projects in the region, including the Emba Hunutlu power plant. Eighteen months later, on January 30, 2018,\\u00a0the expert report\\u00a0for the court case filed by Adana Bar, Turkish Bar Associations, Medical Chamber of Adana, Agriculture and Engineers Chamber of Adana and Do\\u011fu Akdeniz \\u00c7evre Dernekleri (East Mediterranean Environment Associations) was published, acknowledging that the Emba Hunutlu power plant would harm the public health and agricultural production in the area. Then, on October 30, 2018, the hearing of the court case by Adana Bar, Turkish Bar Associations, Medical Chamber of Adana, Agriculture and Engineers Chamber of Adana Do\\u011fu Akdeniz \\u00c7evre Dernekleri (East Mediterranean Environment Associations) was held in Ankara. Despite the expert report, which stated the harmful effects of the plant, the Ankara District Administrative Court\\u00a0decided not to cancel the permit\\u00a0of the Emba Hunutlu power plant.   In April 2019, China Development Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China signed a $1.381 billion syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit facility (loan) agreement with EMBA Elektrik \\u00dcretim A.S. (also known as \\u2018EMBA Electricity Production\\u2019) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Shanghai Electric Power (SEP, 50.01%), AVIC International Project Engineering (2.99%), and two local Turkish investors (47%) \\u2014 for the 1320 MW Coal-Fired Emba Hunutlu Power Station Construction Project. All three banks acted as joint-lead managers and bookrunners and each bank contributed USD 460 million to the overall syndicated loan. See #91516 for ICBC\\u2019s contribution and #91517 for Bank of China\\u2019s contribution. The loan carries a 15-year maturity. It is a senior secured amortizing term loan that matures on March 29, 2034. Sinosure provided two overseas investment (equity and debt) insurance policies, with a maximum underwritten amount of $280 million for the equity component and $2.04 billion for the debt component (covering the loan\\u2019s principal and interest). Both insurance policies covered the risks of inconvertibility and transfer restrictions, expropriation, war and political violence, with an insurance liability period of 180 months. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $1.7 billion commercial (EPC) contract between EMBA Elektrik Uretim A.S., CLP Power Engineering Co., Ltd (CPIPEC or \\u4e0a\\u6d77\\u80fd\\u6e90\\u79d1\\u6280\\u53d1\\u5c55\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8), and AVIC-INTL Project Engineering Company, which was initially signed on October 26, 2017 and subsequently revised and updated on April 25, 2019. The 1320 MW Coal-Fired Emba Hunutlu Power Station Construction Project is being financed as an independent power project (IPP) and financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 1200MW supercritical coal-fired power plant \\u2014 with two 660MW power generation units (\\u2018Unit 1\\u2019 and \\u2018Unit 2\\u2019) \\u2014 in the village of Sug\\u00f6z\\u00fc village, the district of Yumurtal\\u0131k, and the province of Adana near the Syrian border. The project will feature two seawater desalination systems to provide 7,320m\\u00b3 of desalinated water per day for the plant\\u2019s operations. A selective catalytic reduction (SCR) DeNOx system will be installed at the plant for the efficient conversion of harmful oxides of nitrogen into N2\\u00a0and H2O using ammonia. Additionally, facilities such as flue gas desulphurization unit along with dry and wet electrostatic precipitator system will be installed to minimize the dust and particulate emissions from the plant.   The primary infrastructure at the project site will include a turbine building, a crusher house platform, a comprehensive building platform, and an intake platform. In addition, the plant will feature a jetty and associated facilities, and a trestle with a connected road. The power generated by the Hunutlu thermal power plant will be evacuated through 380kV transmission lines and transmitted to the national grid operated by Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation (TEIAS). The plant will be connected to the electricity transmission line between the Mersin 380 substation and the \\u0130sken TPP. A transmission line connecting Hunutlu TPP and Adana 380kV substation will be constructed as part of the project, in addition to three feeder displacement works at Adana 380kV substation. The project also includes the construction a port to receive coal. Upon completion, the plant will reportedly be capable of delivering up to 11.5 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity to the country\\u2019s national grid annually. It is expected to contribute an estimated 3% of all electricity supplied across Turkey. The project also expected to provide employment opportunities for 4,000 employees during construction and 500 employees during production phase.

Preliminary excavation works began in July 2018. Then, a logistical voyage ceremony took place in Shanghai on August 25, 2019, but on-site construction activities did not begin until September 22, 2019. In 2020, Turkey was the worst-hit country by COVID-19 in the MENA region, with over 1.8 million infections. However, altogether 1,831 Chinese and Turkish personnel chose to stay and continue working on the project. In August 2020, to speed up the construction, 455 Chinese staff members flew to Turkey and joined the project, despite the health risks. On February 17, 2020, the project\\u2019s first truss gantry crane was successfully hoisted into place. On March 21, 2020, the first steel structure of the Unit 2 boiler was successfully hoisted into place. On July 22, 2020, the power plant\\u2019s Unit 1 boiler was successfully hoisted into place. On March 10, 2021, the power plant\\u2019s Unit 2 boiler water storage tank furnace was successfully hoisted in place. On April 29, 2021, the steam turbines for Unit 1 and Unit 2 were successfully installed. On September 3, 2021, Unit 1 passed a hydraulic test, thereby laying a foundation for its commissioning. On June 18, 2022, Unit 1 began operations.   In June 2020, this project became a subject of local controversy when more than 20 non-governmental organizations called on Chinese banks to withdraw financial support for a coal-fired power plant under construction in Turkey, citing environmental damage and a disregard for the \\u201cgreen\\u201d pledge of China\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative. The groups sent letters to China Development Bank, Bank of China Ltd., and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., asking them to halt financing for the 1320 MW Coal-Fired Emba Hunutlu Power Station Construction Project.

Sinosure also issued a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy at a cost of $54.3 million, and the borrower pledged the following sources of collateral to the lending syndicate: fixed (project) assets, future rights to electricity charges, and the Sinosure credit insurance policy. Additionally, China Three Gorges Corporation reportedly made a $316.20 million equity investment in project, while Associated Technologies reportedly made a $23.90 million equity investment (captured via Project ID#54012).  The purpose of the independent power project (IPP) is to construct a 720MW hydropower generation complex \\u2014 with four, 180MW power generation units \\u2014 near Karot village, some 1.7 kilometers upstream of Karot Bridge and 74 km upstream of Mangla Dam. The project involves the construction of a roc-filled dam, spillway, powerhouse, diversion tunnels, head-race power tunnels and a tail-race tunnel end. The project site is accessible through the Islamabad \\u2013 Kahuta \\u2013 Kotli road, approximately 29 kilometers from Kahuta, and 65 kilometers from Islamabad. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2,970 GWh (net) of clean energy annually and reduce 2.3 million tons of carbon emissions each year. The IPP is being implemented on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis. KPCL will sell all its energy to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC) under a 30-year power purchase agreement [at a levelized tariff of Rs 7.68 (7.57 cents) per unit]. The Government of Pakistan GoP guaranteed the (power purchase) payment obligations of the NTDC to the KPCL.  The Government of Pakistan also issued a 17% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.   The general EPC contractor responsible for implementation is Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC). China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is also involved in implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 20, 2015. A construction mobilization ceremony was held on January 10, 2016. A project implementation agreement was signed on September 28, 2016. Then, a \\u201cnotice to proceed\\\" was issued to (TGDC) on December 1, 2016. Construction works were 25% complete as of September 2017. On September 22, 2018, the project successfully achieved river closure. Construction works were 70% complete as of January 2020. Then, on May 2, 2021, the first rotor of the power plant was successfully hoisted into place. Construction works were 88% complete as of May 2021. On November 20, 2021, the hydropower station closed the gates of its diversion tunnels and started water storage in its reservoir for future use. To date, the project has reportedly employed 3000-5000 people. The originally expected commercial operation date (COD) of the hydropower plant was December 28, 2021. KPCL is responsible for handing over this project to the Pakistani government after the term of its 30-year concession agreement has expired.  The project has been the subject of local controversy. In August 2019, a complaint was submitted to the IFC\\u2019s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) by a former employee of the project. The complaint raised concerns about lack of payment of exit wages, as well as discrimination against local workers in relation to access to drinking water, conditions of accommodations and transportation at the project site. Then, in July 2020, a complaint was lodged with CAO by representatives of Building and Wood Workers International (BWI) and the Pakistan Federation of Building and Wood Workers (PFBWW), on behalf of the Awami Labor Union. The complaint raises a range of social issues related to the working conditions and terms of employment, workers' organizations, and grievance redress mechanism at the Karot hydropower plant. The complainants claimed adverse impacts on approximately 3,000 project workers, including violations of IFC Performance Standard 2 on workers\\u2019 organizations, health and safety, working conditions and terms of employment, grievance mechanisms, retrenchment, and concerns related to the use of security forces under IFC Performance Standard 4.  There are also some indications that the syndicated loan for the 720MW Karot Hydropower Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. In March 2023, KPCL sought Rs 22.703 billion from Central Power Purchasing Agency\\u2013Guarantee (CPPA-G) by April 10, 2023 to settle its outstanding debts (including principal and interest) to SRF, CDB, China Eximbank, and IFC and avoid default.  In a letter to Rehan Akhtar, the CEO of CPPA-G, KPCL\\u2019s CEO Wang Minsheng noted that his company had to make mandatory principal, interest, and commitment fee payments and any delays in payment would result in a breach of covenants resulting in an event of default for the company.  He noted that, per section 2.05 of the facility agreements signed by KPCL and its lenders, his company needed to make its second loan repayment (equivalent to 3.31 percent of the outstanding loan amount, or Rs. 22.703 billion) by April 21, 2023. KPCL therefore requested that CPPA-G pay its overdue invoices (receivables) -- worth Rs 4.937 billion -- by April 10, 2023.

(327) 14202014016565] worth $482,578,200 for the 183MW Isimba Hydropower Station and the Isimba-Bujagali Interconnection Project. Then, on March 12, 2015, the Parliament of Uganda ratified the loan agreement with the following terms: an annual interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 0.25% ($1,206,445.50) management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $567,738,990.96 commercial contract [number MEMD/WRKS/2013-2014/00022/ERD] between Uganda\\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE), which was signed on September 6, 2013 and amended on April 10, 2014 and May 20, 2014.   Under the terms of the PBC, the Government to Uganda was responsible for on-lending the full amount of the loan to Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL). The Government of Uganda provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the Government of Uganda was obligated under the terms of the loan to open an escrow (or \\u2018repayment reserve\\u2019) account and deposit funds in the account to facilitate repayment and provide security (i.e. collateral) in the event of default. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of the escrow (repayment reserve) account was UGX 35,909,807,892 ($10,772,942.36).  The China Eximbank loan agreement also required that UETCL and UEGCL conclude a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) on a \\u2018take or pay\\u2019 basis for the project, and that UETCL and UEDCL and UMEME (or its successors or assignees) conclude a Power Sale Agreement on a \\u2018take or pay\\u2019 basis, in which UMEME or its successor is obligated to make deposits of revenues generated from the project into the escrow account. The loan agreement also specified that any shortfalls in collections and debt service would be met by the Government of Uganda. UMEME, which became the major privately-owned electricity distributor in Uganda in 2005 after winning a 20-year concession to operate UEDCL's main distribution network, was involved as a contractual signatory to the Isimba PPA in order to safeguard the repayment mechanism and avoid potential risks of revenues being misallocated. The fact that UEGCL was to supply UETCL all available power capacity on a \\u2018take or pay\\u2019 basis means that UETCL was to pay for all available electricity generated by the dam, and not only what was needed. However, in 2019, Uganda\\u2019s Auditor General discovered that the generation and sales licenses were in contradiction of the PPA and loan agreement because they stated that \\u2018the tariff methodology [will] be based on the energy service cost implying that the energy dispatch to UETCL will be influenced by market demand.\\u2019   According to the Government of Uganda\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 97% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 19 loan disbursements (worth $466,398,955.58) between 2015 and 2022: a $28,386,949.55 disbursement on August 14. 2015, a $72,126,626.59 disbursement on August 17, 2015, a $16,593,182.04 disbursement on November 19, 2015, a $70,494,066.49 disbursement on March 30, 2016, a $44,719,245.87 disbursement on November 8, 2016, a $8,903,102.70 disbursement on December 13, 2016, a $11,634,076.30 disbursement on April 18, 2017, a $9,797,214.32 disbursement on May 26, 2017, a $27,630,000 disbursement on August 8, 2017, a $40,394,439.87 disbursement on November 7, 2017, a $25,338,123.26 disbursement on March 30, 2018, a $9,149,993.75 disbursement on June 26, 2018, a $21,647,503.83 disbursement on November 16, 2018, a $13,983,133.08 disbursement on December 17, 2018, a $10,191,519.25 disbursement on April 4, 2019, a $12,490,242.92 disbursement on June 19, 2019, a $13,684,152.17 disbursement on November 8, 2019, a $2,942,702.21 disbursement on September 17, 2020, and a $26,292,681.38 disbursement on October 27, 2022. According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, total loan disbursements amounted to $440,106,274.20 and the loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $391,848,454.20 as of December 31, 2021.   The project involved the construction of Isimba hydropower plant, which is located in the village of Isimba on the Victoria Nile, in Kamuli District. It is 4 km downstream of Simba Falls on the River Nile, approximately 50 km downstream of the source of the Nile. The project site is about 21 km from Kayunga Town as the nearest town and about 65 km from Jinja town.

The project also supported the construction of a 132kv Isimba power substation, and the construction of a 41km, 132kv transmission line from Isimba to Bujagali. The Isimba power station will be installed with four vertical Kaplan turbine-generator units with a capacity of 45.8MW per unit, thereby providing a combined installed capacity of 183.2MW. The expected outputs from the 183MW Isimba hydropower station and the Isimba-Bujagali interconnection Project include (1) construction of the 183 MW Isimba hydropower plant, (2) construction of a 132kv Isimba power substation, and (3) construction of a 132kv Isimba-Bujagali double circuit steel tower power transmission line that is approximately 41 km in length. CWE was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several subcontractors were also involved, including Artelia Eau & Environment, KKATT Consult, and Energy Infratech.   A technical feasibility study, as well as a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Impact Assessment (SIA) for the power plant and transmission line were completed between 2012 and 2014. An SIA undertaken for Isimba dam by the Government of Uganda (GoU) shows that public consultations concerning the project were held in the Kayunga, Kamuli, and Jinja Districts between October and December 2012. The same period is cited for consultations held in connection with the EIA. Field studies of flora and fauna were conducted in March 2013. The EIA was only finished in November 2014 and NEMA granted approval of it on May 19, 2015. The project\\u2019s certificate of approval was also issued by the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MoEMD) in May 2015. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for the dam took place on October 5, 2013. However, project implementation did not commence until April 30, 2015. At that time construction was expected to be completed within 40 months (August 30, 2018). Construction ended in November 2018. Test flooding of the reservoir and the start of inundation of the Kalagala Falls Site (KFS) took place between November 2018 and February 2019. The power plant was officially commissioned on March 22, 2019. A series of \\u2018associated infrastructure works\\u2019 \\u2014 including bridges and a connection road to Kamuli \\u2014 took place after the commissioning of the power plant. The power plant was expected to generate 183.2 megawatts of electricity a year once it achieved a substantial completion mark on March 31, 2019. A takeover certificate was issued to the EPC contractor (CWE) on April 12, 2019, after the Government of Uganda and CWE agreed that all project defects were to be fixed by September 30, 2019. However, on September 16, 2019, local media reports indicated that CWE was stalling the completion of a bridge associated with the 183 MW Isimba dam project over a $42 million payment dispute with UEGCL. CWE alleged that UEGCL was unfairly withholding payment. UEGCL asserted that the payment was being withheld due to nearly 700 dam construction defects that CWE had failed to repair. In June 2021, during a UEGCL board of directors inspection of the project site, the Executive Director of UEGCL, Eng. Harrison Mutikanga, told the media that he was not happy with CWE\\u2019s performance because of delays and quality issues. He said that \\u2018[r]ight now, water is leaking in the concrete to the powerhouse, the contractor has not installed a floating boom, the generator circuit breaker has not been working for one month and because of that, [and] one of the turbine units is not working.\\u2019 He also said that \\u2018[t]he firefighting system automation is also not working, equipment frequently breaks down, the gate on one of the functioning units was designed to last for 10 years but only two years later, the paint is going off and the rubber that is supposed to control water is coming off.\\u2019 Without boom lines, Mutikanga explained that the dam risked being affected by the water hyacinth and floating islands, which could translate into national blackouts. Mutikanga also said the delayed completion of the project had led to government losses: \\u2018We want a plant that is generating electricity reliably, safely and to also make sure that all systems are working. We want all defects fixed with quality equipment so that we contribute to the government objective of social transformation.\\u2019 At the time, Mutikanga also denied allegations that UEGCL had not paid CWE: \\u2018We have paid them up to 93%. We have also started paying the interest on the loan to EXIM Bank (of China).\\u2019 UEGCL Board chairperson Eng. Proscovia Njuki added that: \\u2018[t]he contractor has not been fast as we thought. At first, they were delayed by COVID-19, but we are here to find out the challenges they are facing so that we address them. An agreement was reached to extend the defects liability period by one year to allow for proper completion of all the snags till March 2021, but with the defects we have extended the contract till March 2022. If by then we find out that some gaps are missing, we shall not issue a final certificate of completion.\\u2019 Then, on August 11, 2012, a group of engineers, supervisors, IT specialists, welders, and cleaners\\u2014worked frantically to restore power in one of the turbines at Isimba dam. The previous three days were reportedly \\u2018a nightmare\\u2019 after one of the workers opened a wrong gate during routine maintenance works on unit three\\u2014one of the four Kaplan axial flow turbines\\u2014and then the automated gate jammed, causing a flood that submerged four floors, including the powerhouse. Each of the turbine units has a generation capacity of 45.5 MW but only three had been active after the dam was officially commissioned on March 22, 2019. Uganda's Minister of Energy, Ruth Nankabirwa, and the Permanent Secretary of Uganda's Ministry of Energy, Irene Batebe, pitched camp at the project site. Ms Nankabirwa and her team were ushered into the control room. Across the choppy waters was a group of Australian dam engineers armed with monitors that fed footage to the CCTV room. The images gleaned by the divers were startling. Concrete under the water at the spillway gates continued to wash away and crumbling, among other things. The dam has four spillway gates. A spillway gate is raised and adjustable to allow the controlled release of water downstream whenever water levels in the reservoir\\u2014the large lake behind the dam\\u2014increase[s], including the probable maximum flood. The wearing of spillway waterway concrete requires a total overhaul. In June 30, 2022 correspondence with Irene Batebe, UEGCL chief executive officer, Harrison Mutikanga, flagged the crumbling waterway concrete, saying it was of \\u2018great risk to the overall stability of the dam with possible catastrophic consequences\\u2019 and that \\u2018UEGCL considers this risk to be of paramount importance as any delays to correct these failures only serves to increase the likelihood of these risks materialising and exposing government to great financial and reputational risk.\\u2019 As of August 2022, Isimba dam remained under the Defects Lability Period (DLP)\\u2014 the time period specified in the contract during which the EPC contractor is legally required to return to a construction site to repair any defects. The DLP was set to expire in late 2022. CWE was reportedly reluctant to address the lingering defects until the summer of 2022. In September 2022, UEGCL employees warned of major safety issues and identified 10 \\u2018potentially catastrophic defects\\u2019 at the dam that, if it were to burst, could lead to massive flooding. The allegations of poor quality control on the part of the CWE are not new. In 2016, a legal claim was filed against the Isimba project in response to a leaked report that alleged that CWE was using substandard materials for construction of the dam.\",\"On October 29, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with the Double Pipe Line Project. Under the terms of this framework agreement, China Eximbank pledged to provide a preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) worth $467,840,000 and a government concessional loan (GCL) worth RMB 569,664,000 for the project. China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh finalized the PBC and GCL agreements on November 3, 2017; however, the loans did not become \\u2018effective\\u2019 until April 2018.   The GCL (captured via Project ID#38349) carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The PBC (captured via Project ID#53661) carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The first repayment date for the GCL and the PBC was scheduled for April 2023. The GCL and PBC proceeds were to be used by the borrower to finance a $550.4 million commercial (EPC) contract between Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) and China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau (CPPB), which was signed on December 7, 2016. According to the Government of Bangladesh\\u2019s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the GCL had achieved a disbursement rate of 100% (RMB 569,664,000 out of RMB 569,664,000) as of June 30, 2020, while the PBC had achieved a 0% disbursement rate ($0 out of $467,840,000) as of June 30, 2020 and a 46.7% disbursement rate ($218,773,000 out of $467,840,000) as of June 30, 2021. According to the Government of Bangladesh\\u2019s ERD, the borrower had not made any repayments under the GCL or the PBC as of June 30, 2021.   The purpose of the project is to construct an oil tanker mooring platform and a 200 km underwater and onshore pipeline in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The project was launched because Bangladesh is not capable of handling large vessels carrying imported crude and finished oil, due to the low navigability of a key river channel and constrained facilities at the main seaport in Chittagong. The single-point mooring system, once constructed, is expected help to offload 1.2 lakh tons of crude oil within only 48 hours and 70,000 tons of diesel in 28 hours. Its annual capacity to offload oil will be nine million tons, and it will be able to save Tk800 crore per year. Upon project completion, liquid fuel oil is expected to be carried to Moheshkhali Island, on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district, through the pipeline from large tankers anchored in the deep sea. Later, the 110-km pipelines installed under the Bay of Bengal and in coastal areas is expected to directly carry the oil to the Eastern Refinery in Chattogram from Moheshkhali. The project also involves the construction of a 146-km offshore pipeline and 74-km onshore pipeline to carry imported oil from the sea to a refinery in Chittagong district, some 242 km southeast of Dhaka, for processing.  CPPB, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), is the contractor responsible for constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of the pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast.    In January 2015, CPPB and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources of Bangladesh signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore.    Then, in March 2015, the state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) received a technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team from the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, was expected to review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under Bangladesh\\u2019s Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources (MPEMR). CPPB was then expected to submit a financial offer on completion of the review.   The project was originally expected to take 36 months to complete, but as of October 2018, CPPB had only completed initial surveying and some design work. Construction began on or around February 20, 2019. Drilling then began on March 15, 2019. The project has also completed channel deep post-trenching of the first offshore pipeline despite great technical difficulties. The maximum trenching depth is 11.9 meters, setting a world record for the deepest offshore pipeline post-trenching in the industry and laying a solid foundation for the overall construction of the project.   Work continued during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Strict quality control and safety risk control were reportedly put in place. The project had achieved a 63.5% completion rate as of September 2021 and an 83% completion rate as of June 2022. Its originally scheduled completion date was December 2018. However, it has run behind schedule and is over budget. The project completion deadline was first extended to December 2019. Then, it was extended to June 2022. Then, it was extended again \\u2014 to June 2023. As of 2022, land owners whose plots of land were acquired for the project claimed not yet been compensated despite multiple cost overruns. The total cost of the project reportedly escalated by 44% and some media sources indicate that China Eximbank agreed to upsize its lending commitments for the project by 20.1% (from Tk 3,903.22 crore to Tk 4,688.26 crore).\",\"On June 30, 2015, the Government of Bolivia approved a $492,400,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) [China Eximbank PBC 2015 (08) 350] from China Eximbank for the Rurrenabaque-Riberalta Highway Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 3% interest rate, 6 year grace period, 15 year maturity, 0.25% commitment fee, and 0.25% management (front-end) fee. Upon signature of the loan agreement, the Government of Bolivia had to remit a lump-sum payment of $1.231 million (.025% x $492,400,000) to China Eximbank.   The lender made disbursements worth $0 in 2015, $98,480,000 in 2016, $42,406,123 in 2017, $75,629,694 in 2018, and $48,378,339 in 2019, $18,894,243 in 2020, and $12,5757,695 in 2021. The borrower made no principal repayments between 2015 and 2021. However, it paid interest and/or fees worth $763,668 in 2016, $4,258,765 in 2017, $5,825,928 in 2018, $7,046,159 in 2019, and unknown amount in 2020, and $9,108,710 in 2021. The loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding was $0 as of December 31, 2015, $98,480,000 as of December 31, 2016, $140,886,123 as of December 31, 2017, $216,515,817 as of December 31, 2018, $264,894,156 as of December 31, 2019, $283,788,399 as of December 31, 2020, and $296,364,095 as of December 31, 2021.   The purpose of the 508.07 km highway construction project is to link the departments of La Paz (west), Beni (northeast) and Pando (north), and improve trade between those regions and the rest of the country. The existing gravel highway is to be widened and paved, and 10 bridges will be constructed. The project is divided into four sections: Section I in the town of Rurrenabaque to Santa Rosa (95.68 km), Section II in the town of Santa Rosa to Australia (169.36 km), Section III in the town of Australia to El Choro (168.16 km), and Section IV in the town of El Choro to Riberalta (74.87 km). In June 2012, the original project contract was awarded to Brazilian construction firm Lupe, but was later scrapped due to community opposition related to the proposed route.   China Railway Construction Corporation (International) Limited was then selected as the contractor responsible for project implementation in August 2014. The Bolivian Highway Administration (ABC) issued an order to commence work to China Railway Construction Corporation (International) Limited on November 30, 2015. Construction then began on October 25, 2016. However, in July 2018, construction was halted by the CRCC because little progress was made. As of mid-2019, the project had only achieved a 15% completion rate.   The project has also become a source of local opposition and controversy. Dust, mud, traffic jams, and poor signaling have blighted the road over the past four years, according to residents and drivers who frequently travel between Rurrenabaque and the towns of Reyes and Santa Rosa, 95-kilometres north of the capital La Paz. The situation is reportedly worse during the dry season, when visibility is very poor and causes accidents. Also, small sewers along the route reportedly do not let water flow properly underneath. In February 2019, at the source of the Siwapi River, on the fringes of the the Santa Rosita communal territory, some 20 kilometers from Rurrenabaque, water from the Beni River collapsed the drain. During the same month, a meter\\u2019s worth of water inundated Darnixa Crespo Ciripi's house in the same farming community. Residents of Cosar claim that the size and poor functioning of the drains has caused them to lose chickens, plantain and rice crops. Those affected from the Cosar, Villa Copacabana, San Jos\\u00e9, Puerto Salinas, Wawa 1 and R\\u00edo Viejo communities blocked the road in late February 2019, demanding that ABC build a bridge in Siwapi over the international highway, replacing the collapsed sewer. Then, in May 2019, Bolivia\\u2019s Public Works Minister Oscar Coca threatened to fine China Railway Construction Corporation (International) Limited for breach of contract. He was reportedly said that \\u2018[t]here is a serious problem with a road that goes from Rurrenabaque to Riberalta, \\u2026 [and] unfortunately the company is not complying.\\u2019 Scientists have also expressed serious concerns about moving earth, deforestation, seasonal flooding and the destruction of vegetation during the road\\u2019s construction, as well as non-disclosure of mitigation and compensation measures by China Railway Construction Corporation (International) Limited. One environmental NGO described it as \\u2018the most contentious project in the country\\u2019.\",\"On May 4, 2014, China Eximbank and the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation (ESC) \\u2014 an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise \\u2014 signed a $500 million (ETB 9,727,626,459) loan agreement for the Welkait Sugar Mill Project. The Ethiopian Government issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus as 3% margin, a 14 year maturity, and 4 year grace period. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a $647 million commercial (EPC) contract between ESC and China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd. (CAMCE), which was signed on June 10, 2013.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $500 million (ETB 9,727,626,459) loan for the Welkait Sugar Mill Project achieved a 114% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 44 loan disbursements (worth ETB 11,118,858,284) between 2015 and 2020: an ETB 554,010,424 disbursement on December 25, 2015, an ETB 1,786,218,847 disbursement on May 18, 2016, an ETB 448,903,299 disbursement on December 23, 2016, an ETB 28,238,854 disbursement on December 23, 2016, an ETB 124,292,734 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 138,110,858 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 35,899,704 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 92,355,665 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 296,084,581 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 242,822,856 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 26,193,982 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 20,337,902 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 164,283,295 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 271,695,163 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 106,574,404 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 278,058,734 disbursement on June 21, 2017, an ETB 355,556,821 disbursement on June 21, 2017, an ETB 331,393,450 disbursement on June 21, 2017, an ETB 19,022,653 disbursement on October 20, 2017, an ETB 216,925,077 disbursement on April 4, 2018, an ETB 443,315,855 disbursement on April 4, 2018, an ETB 398,505,561 disbursement on April 4, 2018, an ETB 198,158,894 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 88,128,548 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 384,778,609 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 114,884,096 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 755,478,704 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 424,036,093 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 141,070,367 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 186,832,817 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 198,158,894 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 114,884,096 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 399,053,780 disbursement on November 1, 2018, an ETB 98,778,655 disbursement on November 1, 2018, an ETB 255,406,833 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 207,818,195 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 120,484,148 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 498,639,680 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 199,168,958 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 125,539,899 disbursement on December 24, 2019, an ETB 69,558,427 disbursement on December 24, 2019, an ETB 131,099,561 disbursement on December 24, 2019, an ETB 12,440,636 disbursement on October 22, 2010, and an ETB 15,657,678 disbursement on October 22, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to construct a sugar mill, construct a 135.5 meter-high and 840 meter-wide \\u2018May-Day\\u2019 irrigation dam on the Zarema River (next to the Waldiba Monastery) with the capacity to hold 3.5 billion cubic meters of water, install irrigation equipment, and construct a 4x30MW biogas power station (cogeneration power plant). About 70% of the electricity generated from the biogas power station (also known as the bagasse-fired power plant) will be used to run the sugar mill and 30% will connect to the surrounding area through a 137 kV electricity transmission line. The sugar mill (plant) will use sugarcane planted on 40,000 hectares of land and get irrigation water from the Tekeze, Kalema and Zarema rivers. Once it is fully operational, the sugar mill is expected to crush 24,000 tons of sugarcane per day (tcd), produce 484,000 tons of sugar per year, and produce 41.654 million liters of ethanol per year. The project site is located in Tigray Regional State\\u2019s Western Zone in Welkayit District.   CAMCE is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Sur Construction is a subcontractor responsible for undertaking the construction of the irrigation dam. The project is being implemented in two phases (stages) and financed via two different loan tranches. On April 10, 2014, CAMCE signed a project design contract. Then, on October 9, 2016, a project commencement ceremony took place. Then, on March 15, 2019, Abraham Tekster, the Deputy Governor of Tigray, conducted an on-site project inspection. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 36 months (October 9, 2019). However, as of December 17, 2019, the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP noted that the \\u2018[irrigation] dam [was] not completed\\u2019 and the \\u2018field for sugar cane [was] not fully ready [for] production\\u2019. As of April 2020, the project had only achieved a 95% completion rate. On November 4, 2020, the Welkait Sugar Mill was damaged in an air raid during the Tigray conflict. The Chinese government ended up evacuating more than 600 of its citizens, including 187 employees from the Welkait Sugar Mill.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Welkait Sugar Mill Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. in 2019, Ethiopia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance announced that it was seeking to privatize the Welkait Sugar Mill (as part of a broader effort to address the government\\u2019s debt sustainability problems and the ESC\\u2019s inability to fund the ongoing operations of multiple, faltering sugar factories). Also, according to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On May 20, 2014, Russia's State Corporation Bank for Development & Foreign Economic Affairs \\u2014 also known as Vnesheconombank (VEB) \\u2014 signed a $500 million loan agreement with China Eximbank for the development of the northwestern block of the Elginskoye Coal Deposit in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to facilitate the import of equipment that to develop the Elginskoye Coal Deposit. No project implementation information could be identified as of March 2022. Elginskoye (or Elga) coal mine is a surface coal mine, operated by Mechel and Gazprombank AO, producing 4.3 million tonnes per annum, in southeast Sakha Republic, Russia. It is located in a remote area 415 km east of Neryungri, in Neryungrinsky District, Sakha Republic, Russia. The mine is connected via dirt mining roads to the railway network at Ulak, in Amur Oblast, 210 km away.  On the same day, China EXIM Bank and VEB-Leasing (a subsidiary of VEB) signed another loan agreement for $300 million for similar purposes (see project #66587).\",\"In October 2014, China Development Bank (CDB) and MegaFon signed a financing mandate agreement for an export buyer's credit loan facility worth $500 million for the purchase of Huawei equipment and services. Then, on December 30, 2014, CDB and MegaFon signed the $500 million loan agreement. The loan carried a maturity of 7 years. Its interest rate and grace period are unknown.

The agreement was signed by Sberbank CEO Herman Gref and China Eximbank Vice President Yuan Xingyong.\",\"In August 2015, a syndicate of 3 Chinese banks (Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and the Beijing Branch of China Construction Bank Corporation) and Gazprom \\u2014 a Russian state-owned energy corporation \\u2014 signed a $1.5 billion syndicated loan facility agreement. The loan carried the following terms: a 5-year maturity and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.5% margin. The average 6-month LIBOR rate in August 2015 was 0.519%, so the all-in interest rate has been calculated as 0.519% + 3.5% = 4.019%. The purpose of the loan is not stated in any official documentation. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $500,000,000 (captured via Project ID#98801), that Agricultural Bank of China contributed $500,000,000 (captured in Project iD#98802), and that CCB also contributed $500,000,000 (captured via Project ID#52635) to this syndicated loan.\",\"In March 13, 2013, Golden Agri-Resources Ltd announced that Golden Veroleum Limited had procured a term loan facility from China Development Bank Corporation in an aggregate principal amount of $500 million with a maturity of 15 years. GVL is owned by The Verdant Fund LP, a private equity fund registered in the Cayman Islands. Golden Agri-Resources Ltd, the initial and currently the only investor in the Verdant Fund LP, provided a corporate guarantee for the $500 million CDB loan facility.   The proceeds of the CDB loan facility were to be drawn in stages over 6 years of availability period and applied solely towards the development of an oil palm plantation and related infrastructure in Liberia. In August 2010, the Government of Liberia (GoL) awarded Golden Veroleum Limited a 65-year oil plantation concession. The concession area contains development areas with a total surface area of 220,000 ha within an overall area of interest of 350,000 ha. The concession affects five counties of South-East Liberia: Sinoe, Grand Kru, River Cess, River Gee and Maryland.  \",\"On March 8, 2012, China Eximbank and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development (MINEPAT) signed a $482,800,000 preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2012) 10TOTAL NO.(198) 1420303052012210261] for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project.  The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.30% commitment fee, and a 0.30% management fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan (PBC) to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $568,000,000 commercial (EPC) contract between Cameroon\\u2019s Ministry of Public Works of the Republic of Cameroon and China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC), which was signed on August 8, 2011.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan had achieved a 73.2% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 69.4 billion). The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 188.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the Yaounde-Douala highway project is to facilitate the construction of a 215 km road linking Douala on the western coast with capital Yaounde. Phase 1 will involve construction of a 68.3 km long road, which will run from Yaound\\u00e9 to Bot Makak/Bibodi. The six-lane highway will be the first new motorway since the country's independence. The project seeks to replace the existing hazardous two-lane highway, and it aims to boost domestic and sub-regional trade as well as shorten the distance between Douala and Yaounde from 265 km to 215 km.   CFHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Phase 1 construction activities began on April 15, 2014, and the originally expected project completion date was October 13, 2018; however, by April 29, 2014, there was reportedly a protracted conflict between China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC) and the Control Mission led by the SCET-Tunisie/Louis Berger. Project implementation was delayed by unpaid indemnity owed to those living along the first 10 km of highway. The Cameroonian authorities also reportedly made modifications to the specifications of the project by increasing the speed limit from 100 km/hour to 110 km/hour and adding extra lanes, leading the EPC contractor to assert that according to the budget only 47 km of the road could be constructed under such conditions. By January 2015, construction had recommenced, as reported by the China\\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) who noted that tree felling had taken place along 40 km of the road\\u2019s route and that earthworks had started not long before. Then, in 2017, delays in payment to the contractor led to a one month suspension of construction beginning on May 2, 2017 and concluding in June 2017 after settlements were paid.  As of May 2019, Phase 1 had achieved a 74% completion rate. As of February 2020, the project had achieved a 80% completion rate and 6 of 36 engineering structures were not yet finished. In April 2020, the company in charge of supervising the works, SCET-TUNISIE, reported that the project was scheduled to reach completion by December 2020 in spite of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of August 2021, the project had achieved a 98% completion rate.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon \\u2014 with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 \\u2014 by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) \\u2014 or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon\\u2019s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini \\u00e0 Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.\\u2019\",\"On November 27, 2012, the Chinese Government and the Government of the Republic of Macedonia signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement regarding a preferential credit line for infrastructure and technology projects. Then, on October 25, 2013, China Eximbank and the Public Enterprise for State Roads of the Republic of Macedonia signed a $505,044,966.98 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Kicevo-Ohrid Motorway Construction Project (captured via Project ID#66444). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The PBC was to be repaid in thirty semi-annual installments. On January 9, 2014, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the PBC. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 90% of the $555,549,463.68 cost of a commercial contract [ID#29-01-135] that it signed with Sinohydro Corporation Limited on June 5, 2012. The remaining 10% was provided by the Public Enterprise for State Roads. The 2013 PBC\\u2019s outstanding (principal) amount as of December 31, 2019 was $324,442,683.   The purpose of this project was to construct a 57-km long and 25.2-meter wide highway \\u2014 with 6 overpasses, 13 underpasses, and a 2 km long tunnel named 'Preseka' \\u2014 between the city of Kicevo and the city of Ohrid. The highway will pass through Kicevo, Podvis, Preseka, Pesocani, Trebenista, Podmolje, and Ohrid. Sinohydro Bureau 7. Co. Ltd (\\u4e2d\\u56fd\\u6c34\\u7535\\u4e03\\u5c40\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8) \\u2014 a subsidiary of Sinohydro Corporation Limited \\u2014 was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.   A groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 22, 2014 and the project was originally expected to reach completion on June 30, 2021. However, the project has encountered various delays and cost overruns. Some of these were due to poor geological surveys. Additionally, no intersections were part of the original road plan, which made it impossible to access the highway from villages along its route. To address these cost overruns, China Eximbank and the Public Enterprise for State Roads of the Republic of Macedonia signed an additional PBC agreement worth $179,694,572.51 for the Kicevo-Ohrid Motorway Construction Project in 2019 (captured via Project ID#85195). It carried the same borrowing terms as the PBC that was signed on October 25, 2013: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and and a 0.25% management fee. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of this PBC on November 21, 2019.   On March 26, 2015, Macedonian opposition leader Zoran Zaev released audio recordings related to the construction of the highways. The recordings provided evidence that the tender process had not been transparent, and only two companies had been approved by the Chinese Embassy in Skopje: CWE and Sinohydro Corporation Limited. Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was accused of disregarding CWE's lower bid and taking a bribe from Sinohydro Corporation Limited that amounted to 5% of the value of the commercial contract (approximately EUR 20,000,000). The EU intervened and made a deal in which a special prosecutor was appointed, and the Prime Minister stepped down. The special prosecutor charged the former Prime Minister in Charge of Economic Affairs, the former Minister of Transport, and the former Head of the Public Enterprise for National Roads with \\u2018Abuse of Official Position and Authorization\\u2019 on June 29, 2017. Former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was charged with \\u2018Accepting a Reward for Unlawful Influence\\u2019; he fled and received political asylum in Hungary. By 2019, the Special Prosecutor was also charged with corruption, the statute of limitations had expired, and no one was found guilty. In May of 2019, evidence was presented by newly appointed Director of Public Enterprise for State Roads that Sinohydro had only built 2.7 km of the highways, and had instead relied on subcontractors. Sinohydro Corporation Limited then marked up the subcontractor's invoices by 54% when it presented its invoices to the Public Enterprise for State Roads. Some of the items in the original bid had been marked up by as much as 300%. In 2019, Sinohydro Corporation Limited went through a more transparent tender process to build the Krupishte-Kocani highway, and the price per cubic meter was four times lower. \",\"In 2017, the Henan Branch of China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $500 million agreement with AviaAM Financial Leasing China (AviaAM)  \\u2014 a joint venture between AviaAM Leasing (a Warsaw Stock Exchange-listed and Lithuania-headquartered aircraft leasing company) and Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Company (HNCA) \\u2014 to lease eight Airbus A320 aircraft to Russian airliner Aeroflot for a 12-year period. The legal adviser for the transaction was DLA Piper. The first three aircraft were all delivered on the same day with two delivered in Toulouse and one in Hamburg. All eight aircraft were delivered by September 21, 2017.  As a consequence of the February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western government issued a number of sanctions on the Russian aviation and airline industry. As a result, a number of leasing companies cancelled their lease agreements with Russian airliners. Despite the cancellations, Russia acted to seize the leased aircraft to maintain a fleet of air-worthy aircraft and prevent foreign currency outflows (since leasing contracts are denominated in United States dollars) in violation of the Cape Town Convention, an international treaty that stipulates the return of leased aircraft to their owners when contracts are cancelled. On March 14, 2022, after the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia passed a law to allow foreign-registered aircraft owned by non-Russian lessors to be placed on the Russian registry, making it likely that leasing companies would be unable to recover their assets. 10 Airbus A320-214 aircraft and three Airbus A321-211 owned by AviaAM Financial Leasing China \\u2014 possibly including the eight leased under the 2017 agreement to Aeroflot and/or the 16 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft leased under another 2017 agreement to Aeroflot (Project ID#67151) \\u2014 were re-registered in Russia, making it likely that ICBC Leasing would fail to recover its aircraft.\",\"On April 15, 2019, Talco Aluminium Company (TALCO) \\u2014 a state-owned enterprise (SOE) in Tajikistan\\u2014signed a $545 million engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) plus finance (EPC+F) contract with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) for an Aluminum Smelter Modernization Project (also known as the TALCO 300kt/a Electrolytic Aluminum Production Line Rehabilitation Project). The agreement was only to become effective upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent. On November 1, 2019, the Government oof Tajikistan issued a decree, converting TALCO from an SOE (or so-called \\u2018state unitary enterprise\\u2019) into an open joint-stock company and effectively allowing for its (partial) privatization. Then, on December 4, 2019, Radio Liberty\\u2019s Tajik Service quoted China\\u2019s former ambassador to Tajikistan, Yue Bin, as saying that CMEC would purchase an ownership stake in TALCO in return for the Chinese company investing $545 million. Yue offered no details about the size of any ownership stake to be sold and TALCO has not commented publicly on the prospect of it being partially privatized. However, the conditions for its sale were created. Then, in May 2020, the Government of Tajikistan approved the EPC+F (loan) agreement.   The purpose of the project is to modernize TALCO\\u2019s aluminum smelter in the town of Tursunzoda. The project scope includes rehabilitation of TALCO\\u2019s existing production line electrolytic aluminum series and ancillary facilities. CMEC is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. It is responsible for the design and optimization, procurement of equipment, civil engineering and construction, installation, training, commissioning, warranty and other works of the project. The project\\u2019s construction period is 24 months and it includes two phases; each phase will last for 12 months upon commencement of construction.   CMEC and Global Advanced Manufacturing Institute (GAMI) are the contractors responsible for project design and implementation. As of May 2023, GAMI was undertaking a project feasibility study.   According to a World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) that was published in May 2020, \\u2018[t]he Ministry of Finance [of Tajikistan] does not record non-guaranteed debt of SOEs. In 2019, TALCO, a loss-making state-owned aluminum company, was allowed to borrow without a government guarantee. Subsequently, TALCO has signed a MOU to borrow $545 million from China to modernize its plant. The finalization of contract and associated disbursement are expected in 2020.\\u2019 The IMF also warned that the $545 million loan presents a substantial contingent liability risk, as it is non-guaranteed SOE debt worth 6.5% of Tajikistan\\u2019s GDP.\",\"On March 25, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone signed a framework agreement with a consortium of Chinese companies \\u2014 consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd., China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd. \\u2014 regarding the design and construction of the works necessary for the expansion and upgrading of Port Elizabeth II in Freetown Port (also known as \\u2018Queen Elizabeth II Port\\u2019). Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (\\u585e\\u62c9\\u5229\\u6602\\u5171\\u548c\\u56fd\\u56fd\\u5bb6\\u6e2f\\u53e3\\u53d1\\u5c55\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c) \\u2014 a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) \\u2014 the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years.  On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower\\u2019s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.\\u2019s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the \\u2018New Port\\u2019 (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData\\u2019s \\u2018Staff Comments\\u2019). Sierra Leone\\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (\\u6cf0\\u5bcc\\u91cd\\u88c5\\u96c6), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidifore will collect a \\u2018development levy fee,\\u2019 which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone\\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower\\u2019s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone\\u2019s contingent liability).  The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.  This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project\\u2014National Port Development (SL) Ltd.\\u2014was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone\\u2019s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone\\u2019s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country\\u2019s GDP) on the government\\u2019s books.\",\"In 2017, China Eximbank and Iran\\u2019s Bank of Industry and Mine \\u2014 an Iranian state-owned bank\\u2014 signed an RMB 3,591,317,330 ($602 million) buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the 913MW Lamard Combined Cycle Power Plant Project. Iran\\u2019s Ministry of Economy issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan in February 2017.

The project also involves the construction of an 11 km electricity transmission line, a 35 kilometer electricity transmission line, a 230kV electricity substation, and a 400kV electricity substation to evacuate power from the power plant to the national grid. The plant itself is located at the 8th km on Lamerd-Khonj road with the city of Lamerd. The locational coordinates of the plant are 27.335372, 53.157570. The construction of the plant is being implemented on a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) basis and financed with 85% debt and 15% equity. Ghadir Electricity & Energy Investment Co. and China National Electric Engineering Co (CNEEC) are the contractors responsible for implementation. By June 2019, the power plant was apparently under construction, including preliminary civil works. Then, in 2020, the first phase of the aluminum smelter launched (with two additional phases slated for 2025). As of August 2022, the project had achieved a 40% completion rate and the construction of the 11 km electricity transmission line and the electricity substations had reached completion. The Chinese Government has also provided a loan for the construction of the aluminum smelter run by South Aluminum Corporation (captured in Project ID#85267).\",\"In June 2011, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $500 million stand-by credit facility agreement with Telemar Norte Leste SA (TMAR), a Brazil-based telecommunications company and subsidiary of Oi SA., in order to meet other debt repayment obligations. The borrowing terms included a 2.898% interest rate (LIBOR plus 230 basis points), a 5-year maturity, and no grace period. Interest would be payable semi-annually through maturity in June 2016. The principal of these loans is payable commencing in October 2014. In July 2011, CDB disbursed $380 million. As of December 31, 2012, the outstanding principal amount under this credit facility was $380 million.  This is not the first time CDB has lent to TMAR or its parent company Oi. In 2009, CDB provided a $300 million loan to Oi to purchase Huawei equipment (see Project ID#38142). In 2011, CDB provided a $500 million credit facility for debt repayment purposes (see Umbrella Project ID#59418). In 2015, CDB provided two separate $600 million loans to Oi: one for purchasing more Huawei equipment (see Project ID#59744) and another to help refinance TMAR's debts (see Project ID#59611).  In June 2016, Oi SA filed Brazil's largest ever bankruptcy. Consequently, they were not able to meet their repayment obligations to CDB. On June 29, 2016, the request for processing the Judicial Reorganization of Oi Group was granted by the Judicial Reorganization Court and the respective Judicial Reorganization Plan (\\\"PRJ\\\") was approved by Oi Group creditors at the Creditors\\u2019 General Meeting held on December 19 and 20, 2017 and ratified by the Judicial Reorganization Court by decision issued on January 8, 2018.

Upon completion, the facility is expected to produce 242,000 tons of sugar and 20 million 827 liters ethanol a year at full capacity. As part of the project, extensive irrigation infrastructure is also being constructed on Omo River in order to enable 100,000 hectares of land to be covered with sugarcane.  Jiangxi Jianglian International Engineering Co. Ltd (JJIEC), a subsidiary of Jianglian Heavy Industry, is the contractor responsible for project implementation. According to the ESC, the project is being undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 construction activities commenced in November 2016. To date, 30,000 hectares of land at the project site have been irrigated, of which 16,0000 hectares are covered with sugarcane.   However, this project has also become a source of scandal and controversy. On July 25, 2017, Yuan Jialin, the JJIEC head of the Omo Kuraz 5 Project, was detained in relation to an alleged act of corruption: paying a $30 million bribe (\\u2018commission\\u2019) for Ethiopian Ministry of Finance officials to illegally grant a contract to JJIEC. Yuan Jialin, wrote a letter to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on May 29, 2018, requesting his personal intervention. In his letter, he indicated that he had been denied bail for nearly a year. He also wrote that \\u201cJJIEC [\\u2026] operates on the highest standard and uses fair and competitive system of procurement and carefully controls projects at hand to be free from corruptive and fraudulent activities.\\\" Jialin also argued in the letter that it was difficult to commit corruption in a strictly monitored purchase process. He claimed that there has not been any evidence to substantiate the charges brought against him. He also noted that, while JJIEC recruited a lawyer to investigate the alleged corruption, he was subjected to an inappropriate search which resulted in physical and psychological damages to him. He also asserted that the documentary evidence presented to substantiate the charges against him were counterfeit. He also warned that the \\u2018dire situation\\u2019 of the Omo Kuraz 5 project might hamper the bilateral relations between the Ethiopian Government and JJIEC, and requested that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed establish a neutral and separate body to see his case and give him a speedy trial.  There are indications that the ICBC loan for the Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements for the Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country.' Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On January 6, 2019, Senegal\\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that during a visit to Senegal from Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that the Chinese Government would finance the construction of the Mbour-Fatick-Kaolack Highway. Then, in 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Senegal signed a $619,961,775.90 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Mbour-Fatick-Kaolack Highway Construction Project. The estimated borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 17.9551 maturity, a 6.632 grace period, and a 2.2746% interest rate. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $738 million commercial contract with CCCC First Highway Engineering Bureau.   The project involves the construction of an expressway route (A2) from Mbour, Senegal connecting onwards to Fatick and Kaolack, and the expressway will be approximately 100 km with 2x2 lanes both 3.5 meters wide, a left side strip that is 1 meter wide, and an emergency stop strip 3 meters wide. The project will also construct an embankment on the side of the road.   CCCC First Highway Engineering Bureau was selected as the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation in May 2021.  Then, in November 2021, project implementation commenced.  At that time, the project was expected to reach completion by August 2025.\",\"On December 8, 2016, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed a $550 million loan facility agreement with the Government of Angola for Phase 2 of Kilamba Kiaxi Housing Construction Project.  The facility has a 16-year maturity and a 3-year grace period, but its interest rate is unknown. Repayments were scheduled to commence in December 2019 (at the end of the loan availability period). The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower finance up to 85% of the cost of a $607 million commercial contract CITIC Construction as well as 85% of the cost of a Sinosure credit insurance policy (premium). As of March 31, 2022, the loan had not yet disbursed.   The purpose of the project is to design and build 10,000 social housing units and related infrastructure-- including roads, water supply and drainage systems, sewage systems, electric lighting systems, reclaimed water systems, afforestation, traffic signals, natural gas systems, and telecommunication systems-- in Kilamba New City (Kilamba Kiaxi Housing District). CITIC Construction \\u2014 a subsidiary of CITIC Group, a Chinese state owned conglomerate \\u2014 signed the EPC contract with a work period of 28 months on December 21, 2015  Implementation began on April 24, 2017.   ICBC also provided a $2.5 billion loan for Phase 1 of the Kilamba Kiaxi Housing Construction Project (as captured via Project ID#47101).\",\"On September 19, 2016, a special purpose vehicle called Angkor International Airport Investment (Cambodia) Co., Ltd. [\\u5434\\u54e5\\u56fd\\u9645\\u673a\\u573a\\u6295\\u8d44\\uff08\\u67ec\\u57d4\\u5be8\\uff09\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8] \\u2014 that is jointly owned by Yunnan Investment Group, Yunnan Overseas Investment, and Yunnan Airport Group Co., Ltd. \\u2014 was officially registered. Then, in 2021, a group of Chinese state-owned banks provided a $660 million syndicated loan to Angkor International Airport Investment (Cambodia) Co., Ltd. for the Siem Reap Angkor International Airport Project. The lenders were China Development Bank (as the Arranger, the Agent, and the Leading Bank); Yunnan Branch of Export-Import Bank of China (as the Joint Lead Bank); China Construction Bank (as a Participant Bank); Phnom Penh Branch of Bank of China (as a Participant Bank); and Phnom Penh Branch of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (as a Participant Bank). China Development Bank Yunnan Branch conducted multi-party communications with the Cambodian Government, enterprises, and financial institutions, and took the lead in setting up a $660 million syndicated loan to support the construction of the airport. The maturity length of the loan is 20 years. The total project cost is $880 million and it is being financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Yunnan Investment Group made a $220 million equity investment in this project (see Project ID#66058).   The purpose of the project is to construct a Level-4E airport in the Teuk Laak commune within the Toul Kork district, including an airstrip, 50,000 square meters terminal building, and supporting facilities like a 24.5 km airport road. Siem Reap Angkor International Airport is 40 km away from Angkor Wat and 51 km away from Siem Reap urban area, and the airport project covers an area of 700 hectares and another 1000 hectares of comprehensive development land. Upon completion, the new airport is expected to be able to handle 7 million passengers annually. The existing Angkor International Airport in Siem Reap is only 5 kilometers away from Angkor Wat (a Buddhist temple and the largest religious monument in the world) and has only one runway. As the existing airport is too close to Angkor Wat, the vibration generated by the take-off and landing of aircraft could damage the foundation of the Buddhist temple, and the airport\\u2019s throughput capacity cannot meet the rapid development of tourism.   The Siem Reap Angkor International Airport Construction Project is being implemented on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis. Angkor International Airport Investment (Cambodia) Co., Ltd. was granted a 55-year concession to construct and operate the airport and it will be handed over to the Cambodian Government after the end of this period. Angkor International Airport Investment (Cambodia) Co., Ltd., in turn, hired Shanxi Mechanization Construction Group to assist with project implementation activities. Construction began on March 15, 2020. However, project implementation was halted for an unidentified reason in 2020 (most likely the Covid-19 pandemic). However, in a meeting with H.E. Mao Havannall, Minister in charge of State Secretariat of Civil Aviation (SSCA) in Phnom Penh on May 11, 2020, Mr. Lu Wei, Chairman of Angkor International Airport Investment (Cambodia) Co., Ltd., said that the on-site work had resumed. Then, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the construction of the Angkor International Airport Project was signed June 4, 2020. By May 2021, the project had achieved a 42% completion rate. An initial loan disbursement of $60 million was also released in 2021. The Siem Reap Angkor International Airport Construction Project was originally scheduled for completion on March 14, 2023.\",\"In June 2014, a syndicate of banks (including Bank of China, Deutsche Bank, BTMU, and HSBC Holdings Plc) signed a syndicated $2.4 billion oil prepayment facility agreement with a joint venture (\\u2018orphan special purpose vehicle\\u2019) of BP Plc (\\u2018BP\\u2019) and PJSC Rosneft Oil Company (\\u2018Rosneft\\u2019). Lloyds Banking Group Plc was originally planning to participate in the bank syndicate, but it eventually pulled out of the deal due to concerns about Russia\\u2019s activities in Ukraine. The monetary value of Bank of China\\u2019s contribution to the syndicated is unknown.     The facility had a 5-year maturity, 2-year grace period, an interest rate of 1-month LIBOR plus a 2% margin, and it was available up to 90 days from the agreement signing date. The facility was secured by the assignment of export contracts for oil products. The proceeds from the facility were to be used to finance BP\\u2019s purchase of crude oil, fuel oil, naphtha, gasoil, diesel, kerosene, gasoline or other petroleum products from Rosneft.     The offtake contract was for a total of up to 12 million tons of petroleum products \\u2014 that is, for up to 2.4 million metric tons a year for the five-year duration of the contract. The offtaker's payments for each cargo was made via irrevocable letters of credit. The final documentation offered provisions allowing the lenders to replace BP as the offtaker in the event the company's financial condition deteriorated to the extent that it was unable to meet its payment obligations or in the event sanctions prohibited it from performing its obligations under the offtake contract. According to the agreement, Rosneft was required to ensure that no more than 85% of the commodity exports were, at any time, subject to any security.\",\"In May 2018, Cambodia\\u2019s Council of Ministers approved a proposal for the 700 MW Sihanoukville CIIDG Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project to be implemented on a build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) basis through a 35-year concession agreement. Then, on April 15, 2020, Huadian Sihanoukville Power Generation Co Ltd. \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of China Huadian Hong Kong Company Limited (CHDHK) and Cambodia International Investment Development Group (CIIDG) \\u2014 signed a $600 million loan agreement with ICBC Asia and ICBC Phnom Penh Branch for Phase 1 of the 700 MW Sihanoukville CIIDG Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 700 MW coal-field power plant on a 54.9 hectare parcel of land in the coastal district of Stung Hav within Preah Sihanouk Province. The power plant will consist of two 350 MW supercritical coal-fired power units. An 8,000-ton coal berth and a 1.5-kilometer 230 kV transmission line will also be built. Under the terms of a 35-year concession agreement, Huadian Sihanoukville Power Generation Co Ltd. will sell the power to \\u00c9lectricit\\u00e9 du Cambodge (EdC) for $0.0743 per kilowatt hour (kWh). The power plant will be constructed in two phases, with each phase capable of producing about 350 MW (net) of baseload power. Phase 1 was originally expected to be connected to the national grid by 2023, and Phase 2 was originally expected to be connected to the national grid by 2024. Southwest Electric Power Design Institute (SWEPDI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of China Power Engineering, is the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of Phase 1.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 began on December 18, 2019. However, media reports indicate that the project\\u2019s environmental impact assessment (EIA) was not presented to the provincial government in a meeting until July 2020. At that meeting, the provincial government expressed support for the project, but stated the EIA still required national-level approval. Construction reportedly commenced on or around August 18, 2020.  Huadian Sihanoukville Power Generation Co Ltd (HSPGC) reportedly put online the \\\"number-two unit\\\" of its 700MW coal-fired HSPGC Power Plant on December 16, 2022.\",\"On December 18, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) signed two separate loan agreements with a total value of $1.2 billion with Telemar Norte Leste S.A. (TMAR), a Brazilian telecommunications company and subsidiary of Oi S.A. The first was a $600 million buyer's credit loan and the second was a $600 million refinancing credit agreement. Oi S.A. served as guarantor for both loans.  The purpose of the buyer's credit (captured via Project ID#59744) was to purchase equipment and services from Huawei Technologies. The original borrowing terms included a 9.5-year maturity (final maturity date: June 18, 2025), no grace period, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. Under the original buyer\\u2019s credit agreement, the principal amount was to be amortized with 14 semiannual installments taking place from April 2019 to June 2025. The purpose of the refinancing credit agreement (captured via Project ID#59611) was to help repay previous CDB loans. The original borrowing terms included a 5-year maturity (final maturity date: December 18, 2020), no grace period, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 190 basis points. Under the original refinancing credit agreement, the principal amount was to be amortized with 14 semiannual installments taking place from April 2019 to December 2020.  Then, in June 2016, Oi S.A. (\\u201cOi\\u201d) filed Brazil's largest ever bankruptcy. Consequently, the borrower was unable to meet its repayment obligations to CDB until 2023 at the earliest. After a nearly 2-year long process, creditors of Oi and several of its subsidiaries \\u2014 including Telemar Norte Leste S.A. (TMAR) \\u2014 approved a plan of reorganization at a creditors meeting on December 19, 2017, held in a former Olympic boxing venue on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, to restructure nearly $20 billion in claims, the largest corporate restructuring in the history of Latin America (and potentially any emerging market), and the first truly public Brazilian company to go through judicial restructuring since Brazil reformed its insolvency laws in 2005. After initially considering an attempted out-of-court exchange in the spring of 2016, Oi and several of its subsidiaries filed for judicial reorganization in Brazil in June 2016, and the Brazilian reorganization court accepted jurisdiction over each of the debtors, including Oi\\u2019s two Dutch finance subsidiaries, Oi Brasil Holdings Co\\u00f6peratief U.A. (\\u201cCoop\\u201d) and Portugal Telecom International Finance B.V. (\\u201cPTIF\\u201d). Shortly thereafter, Oi and/ or certain other of the debtors in Brazil filed for additional protection in ancillary proceedings in New York and the United Kingdom, as well as separate proceedings in the Netherlands. In Brazil, as in most countries, the bankruptcy law respects the corporate separateness of debtors, and therefore it is the general rule that, within a corporate group restructuring, creditors\\u2019 claims will not be treated pari passu with those of creditors of other members of the corporate group. However, particularly since the Rede Energia S.A. restructuring in 2014, Brazilian courts have increasingly confirmed restructuring plans for Brazilian corporate groups that substantively consolidate creditor claims, even over the objections of creditors. Oi\\u2019s initial proposed restructuring plan, presented in September 2016, took a substantively consolidated approach. Various creditor groups opposed such substantive consolidation (albeit for different reasons), and filed motions against substantive consolidation with the restructuring court. An appeals court in Rio de Janeiro ultimately decided that the question of substantive consolidation was one that should be determined by creditors by vote at a creditors meeting. Importantly, the judge ruled that this vote should occur on an entity-by-entity basis, thereby providing the creditors of Oi and its debtor-subsidiaries with an important protection by ultimately leaving the decision on whether to accept substantive consolidation in the hands of creditors \\u2013 if creditors at any particular entity were to reject substantive consolidation, it would present significant difficulties for the rest of the Oi Group to restructure on a substantively consolidated basis. If this decision is adopted more widely as precedent in Brazil, it could represent an important step in the right direction towards protecting creditors\\u2019 interest against unfettered substantive consolidation. In Oi\\u2019s case, a consensual deal with creditors was eventually reached, and creditors of each debtor entity voted in favor of substantive consolidation. Oi\\u2019s restructuring plan was approved, on a substantively consolidated basis, on December 19, 2017, after a nearly two-year process. The plan was confirmed by the Brazilian restructuring court in January 2018. Then, on June 21, 2018, Telemar Norte Leste S.A. and CDB reached an agreement to restructure $671,479,642.10 of outstanding debt under a revised set of repayment terms, including an additional 66-month grace period, a fixed interest rate of 1.75%, and a revised repayment schedule (with non-linear amortization) beginning on August 25, 2023 and ending February 25, 2035 (as captured via Project ID#96429). \",\"On August 20, 2009, the Government of the People\\u2019s Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Serbia entered into an Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation in the field of Infrastructure, which entered into force on June 25, 2010. Then, on April 26, 2012, the Government of the People\\u2019s Republic of China announced that it had set up a 10 billion U.S. dollar line of credit to support cooperative projects with Central and Eastern Europe. The credit line would be partially in the form of preferential loans and would fund projects in the infrastructure, technology and green economy sectors.  Then, on May 29, 2013, the Government of the Republic of Serbia submitted a preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) application to China Eximbank for Phase 2 of the Kostolac B Power Plant Project. Then, on December 17, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Serbia signed a PBC agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK NO. PBC (2014) 47 (341)] worth $608,260,000.00 for Phase 2 of the Kostolac B Power Plant Project. The loan (PBC) carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2.5%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 7 year grace period, a 20 year maturity, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.    On March 20, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Serbia and Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) \\u2014 a Serbian state-owned power company \\u2014 signed an on-lending agreement [No. 48-1642/2012-2] for Phase 2 of the Kostolac B Power Plant Project. The proceeds from the on-lending agreement were used to finance 85% of the $715,600,000.00 cost of the commercial contract [number 127/26-13] between EPS, Termoelektrane i kopovi Kostolac d.o.o. (a project company and wholly owned subsidiary of EPS), and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on November 20, 2013.    The loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding was $122,456,000 as of December 31, 2018, $137,382,000 as of December 31, 2019, $175,619,000 as of December 31, 2020, $229,303,000 as of December 31, 2021, and $346,852,000 as of September 31, 2022.    Phase 2 has two sub-components. The first sub-component involves the construction of a new 350MW power generating unit (B3) at the Kostolac B Power Plant. B3 is expected to produce 2.5 billion kWh of electricity annually, increasing the total output capacity of EPS by 5%. This subcomponent was originally expected to take approximately 52 months to complete. Phase 2 also involved the expansion of the Drmno Open Cast Mine from an annual output of nine to 12 million tons of coal. The expansion of the Drmno Mine consists of a rotary excavator, eight conveyors with 12 km-long conveyor system and a spreader with the capacity of 8,500 cubic meters per hour, as well as two new substations. This subcomponent was originally expected to take approximately 47 months to complete.  CMEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation of both components of Phase 2. The PBC that supported Phase 2 went into effect on May 25, 2015 when China Eximbank informed the borrower that it had met all of the \\u201cconditions precedent\\u201d in the loan agreement. This \\u2018Notification of Effectiveness\\u2019 triggered an advance payment worth 25% of the project value ($178.9 million) from EPS to CMEC in June/July 2015.   Then, an opening ceremony for the expansion of the coal mine then took place on January 23, 2017. Two construction permits for the B3 power generation unit \\u2014 one for the chimney and one for the water treatment facility \\u2014 were issued on July 14, 2017. Then, a formal Phase 2 commencement ceremony took place on November 20, 2017. A permit for construction of the B3 turbine, boiler, and generator was issued on April 15, 2019. Then, on May 15, 2020, CMEC successfully started concreting the boiler foundation. As of January 2021, Phase 2 implementation was still underway. The Phase II construction of the power plant B3 had a planned completion date of 2021, but the project was delayed and is now expected to be completed in late 2022.    China Eximbank also financed Phase 1 of the project (see Project ID#42549), which involved the reconstruction of 2 existing power generation units (B1 and B2) at the Kostolac B Power Plant. It is expected that, upon completion, the entire power plant \\u2014 including the two upgraded 350MW units from Phase 1 (B1 and B2) and the third 350MW unit from Phase 2 (B3) \\u2014 will be able to provide about one-fifth of Serbia\\u2019s total electricity supply.\",\"In October 2014, Jordan\\u2019s National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) signed a 30-year power purchase agreement with a consortium led by Eesti Energia (Enefit) \\u2014 an Estonian utility company that operates most of the world\\u2019s installed oil shale generation capacity \\u2014 to build an oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat (Attarat um Ghudran), a town located 100 km southeast of Amman. The exact locational coordinates of the power plant are 31\\u00b016\\u203208\\u2033N 36\\u00b026\\u203252\\u2033E. It was envisaged that the plant would utilize Jordan\\u2019s vast reserves of oil shale and help reduce the country\\u2019s reliance upon imports of oil products for power generation. Upon completion, this plant was expected to consume around 10 million tons of oil shale per year and generate 470 megawatts of baseload power by 2021. The plant would reportedly generate enough power to meet 10-15% of Jordan's electricity needs (about 3.7 billion kWh). NEPCO would act as the plant\\u2019s sole offtaker. The total cost of this project was $2.11 billion and it was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.   On March 16, 2017, a consortium of four Chinese state-owned banks signed a $1.582 billion syndicated loan agreement with Attarat Power Company (APCO) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and project company that is owned by YTL Power International Bhd of Malaysia (45% ownership stake), Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd of China (45% ownership stake), and Eesti Energia AS (Enefit) of Estonia (10% ownerships stake) \\u2014 for the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project. The syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit loan reportedly consisted of a $594 million contribution from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (captured in Project ID#52552), a $594 million contribution from Bank of China (captured in Project ID#72499), a $244 million contribution from China Construction Bank (captured in Project ID#72500), and a $150 million contribution from China Eximbank (captured in Project ID#72502). The borrowing terms were as follows: a 15 year maturity and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.426% in March 2017) plus a 3% margin. Sinosure provided buyer\\u2019s credit insurance to the the borrower. An extensive security package was also provided to the lenders that covers all of the infrastructure and materials required to operate the plant, including over the valuable land concession from the Government of Jordan.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that APCO signed with Guangdong Power Engineering Corporation (GPEC) \\u2014 a subsidiary of China Energy Engineering Corporation \\u2014 on October 31, 2014. Under the terms of this EPC contract, GPEC agreed to undertake, on a turnkey basis, the design, engineering, procurement, construction, erection, interconnection, commissioning, start-up, testing, completion, placing in operation and delivery of the oil shale fired electric generation plant. Foster Wheeler was responsible for the provision of the circulating fluidized bed boilers. Siemens was responsible for the provision of steam turbine generators. Worley Parsons was responsible or the design of the power plant. In addition to the debt financing that was used to support this project, the shareholders in APCO agreed to provide \\u2018base shareholder funding\\u2019 (i.e. equity investments) of up to $528 million. These equity contributions were announced on March 16, 2017 after Enefit of Estonia and Near East Investment sold a 15% equity stake in APCO to YTL Power International Bhd and a 45% equity stake in APCO to Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd (see Project ID#64457). Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd is a Chinese state-owned utility that is jointly owned by Guangdong Province (76% equity stake) and China Huaneng Group (24% equity stake).   As of 2017, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project was the largest private sector investment and example of limited recourse financing in Jordan\\u2019s history. Upon completion, it was expected to have 554MW of gross power generation capacity and 477MW of net power generation capacity. It was expected to consist of two circulating-fluidized-bed units and draw oil shale from a nearby open cast mine. It was expected to employ 5,500 individuals (including 2,000 Chinese nationals) during the construction phase and 1,000 individuals each year after the construction phase is completed. On March 16, 2017, APCO issued a \\u2018notice to proceed\\u2019 to the EPC contractor (GPEC). Then, on March 20, 2017, construction began.   Project implementation was suspended for two months during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, construction resumed in May 2020. The project is ultimately expected to deliver power generation capacity in two phases: 235MW in 2020 and 235MW in 2021. APCO has entered into a 30-year agreement with NEPCO for the sale of the plant\\u2019s entire power generation capacity following its construction. The 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant project is expected to deliver capacity in two phases, 235 MW in 2H 2020 and 235 MW in 1H 2021. Unit 1 of the 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant, which also includes an open-cast mine, was synchronized with Jordan\\u2019s national grid on May 26, 2021. As of the same date, the entire project had achieved a 96% completion rate. However, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project has become a source of local controversy. To facilitate repayment of the loan (and provide a financial return to its equity holder), APCO entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with National Electric Power Corporation (NEPCO), the Jordanian state-owned power utility. NEPCO agreed to serve as the sole offtaker (i.e., single buyer) and purchase all power generated by the oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat at a price of approximately $0.17 per kilowatt hour (kWh). However, NEPCO signed several other PPAs with private companies around the same time, which resulted in too much power generation capacity and not enough customers.   As of late 2021, many of APCO\\u2019s competitors were selling electricity at $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which put NEPCO between a rock and a hard place: it is contractually obligated to purchase power from APCOM at $0.17 per kWh without enough customers to whom it can resell the power.  On December 19, 2020, NEPCO and the Government of Jordan (GOJ) initiated international arbitration proceedings against APCO with respect to the PPA and the GOJ guarantee of NEPCO\\u2019s payment obligations. NEPCO and the GOJ sought declaratory judgments that (a) the $0.17 per kWh tariff is \\u2018grossly unfair\\u2019 and (b) NEPCO can terminate the PPA if its \\u2018gross unfairness\\u2019 is not addressed. APCO has insisted that its loan agreement with ICBC, China Eximbank, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank was based on an internal rate of return (IRR) calculation of 17% (which in turn is based on the $0.17 per kWh tariff) and that it won\\u2019t be able to repay its debts if the IRR and tariff rate are downwardly revised.\",\"In October 2014, Jordan\\u2019s National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) signed a 30-year power purchase agreement with a consortium led by Eesti Energia (Enefit) \\u2014 an Estonian utility company that operates most of the world\\u2019s installed oil shale generation capacity \\u2014 to build an oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat (Attarat um Ghudran), a town located 100 km southeast of Amman. The exact locational coordinates of the power plant are 31\\u00b016\\u203208\\u2033N 36\\u00b026\\u203252\\u2033E. It was envisaged that the plant would utilize Jordan\\u2019s vast reserves of oil shale and help reduce the country\\u2019s reliance upon imports of oil products for power generation. Upon completion, this plant was expected to consume around 10 million tons of oil shale per year and generate 470 megawatts of baseload power by 2021. The plant would reportedly generate enough power to meet 10-15% of Jordan's electricity needs (about 3.7 billion kWh). NEPCO would act as the plant\\u2019s sole offtaker. The total cost of this project was $2.11 billion and it was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.   On March 16, 2017, a consortium of four Chinese state-owned banks signed a $1.582 billion syndicated loan agreement with Attarat Power Company (APCO) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and project company that is owned by YTL Power International Bhd of Malaysia (45% ownership stake), Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd of China (45% ownership stake), and Eesti Energia AS (Enefit) of Estonia (10% ownerships stake) \\u2014 for the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project. The syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit loan reportedly consisted of a $594 million contribution from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (captured in Project ID#52552), a $594 million contribution from Bank of China (captured in Project ID#72499), a $244 million contribution from China Construction Bank (captured in Project ID#72500), and a $150 million contribution from China Eximbank (captured in Project ID#72502). The borrowing terms were as follows: a 15 year maturity and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.426% in March 2017) plus a 3% margin. Sinosure provided buyer\\u2019s credit insurance to the the borrower. An extensive security package was also provided to the lenders that covers all of the infrastructure and materials required to operate the plant, including over the valuable land concession from the Government of Jordan.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that APCO signed with Guangdong Power Engineering Corporation (GPEC) \\u2014 a subsidiary of China Energy Engineering Corporation \\u2014 on October 31, 2014. Under the terms of this EPC contract, GPEC agreed to undertake, on a turnkey basis, the design, engineering, procurement, construction, erection, interconnection, commissioning, start-up, testing, completion, placing in operation and delivery of the oil shale fired electric generation plant. Foster Wheeler was responsible for the provision of the circulating fluidized bed boilers. Siemens was responsible for the provision of steam turbine generators. Worley Parsons was responsible or the design of the power plant. In addition to the debt financing that was used to support this project, the shareholders in APCO agreed to provide \\u2018base shareholder funding\\u2019 (i.e. equity investments) of up to $528 million. These equity contributions were announced on March 16, 2017 after Enefit of Estonia and Near East Investment sold a 15% equity stake in APCO to YTL Power International Bhd and a 45% equity stake in APCO to Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd (see Project ID#64457). Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd is a Chinese state-owned utility that is jointly owned by Guangdong Province (76% equity stake) and China Huaneng Group (24% equity stake).   As of 2017, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project was the largest private sector investment and example of limited recourse financing in Jordan\\u2019s history. Upon completion, it was expected to have 554MW of gross power generation capacity and 477MW of net power generation capacity. It was expected to consist of two circulating-fluidized-bed units and draw oil shale from a nearby open cast mine. It was expected to employ 5,500 individuals (including 2,000 Chinese nationals) during the construction phase and 1,000 individuals each year after the construction phase is completed. On March 16, 2017, APCO issued a \\u2018notice to proceed\\u2019 to the EPC contractor (GPEC). Then, on March 20, 2017, construction began. Project implementation was suspended for two months during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, construction resumed in May 2020.   The project is ultimately expected to deliver power generation capacity in two phases: 235MW in 2020 and 235MW in 2021. APCO has entered into a 30-year agreement with NEPCO for the sale of the plant\\u2019s entire power generation capacity following its construction. The 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant project is expected to deliver capacity in two phases, 235 MW in 2H 2020 and 235 MW in 1H 2021. Unit 1 of the 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant, which also includes an open-cast mine, was synchronized with Jordan\\u2019s national grid on May 26, 2021. As of the same date, the entire project had achieved a 96% completion rate. However, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project has become a source of local controversy. To facilitate repayment of the loan (and provide a financial return to its equity holder), APCO entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with National Electric Power Corporation (NEPCO), the Jordanian state-owned power utility. NEPCO agreed to serve as the sole offtaker (i.e., single buyer) and purchase all power generated by the oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat at a price of approximately $0.17 per kilowatt hour (kWh). However, NEPCO signed several other PPAs with private companies around the same time, which resulted in too much power generation capacity and not enough customers. As of late 2021, many of APCO\\u2019s competitors were selling electricity at $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which put NEPCO between a rock and a hard place: it is contractually obligated to purchase power from APCOM at $0.17 per kWh without enough customers to whom it can resell the power.    On December 19, 2020, NEPCO and the Government of Jordan (GOJ) initiated international arbitration proceedings against APCO with respect to the PPA and the GOJ guarantee of NEPCO\\u2019s payment obligations. NEPCO and the GOJ sought declaratory judgments that (a) the $0.17 per kWh tariff is \\u2018grossly unfair\\u2019 and (b) NEPCO can terminate the PPA if its \\u2018gross unfairness\\u2019 is not addressed. APCO has insisted that its loan agreement with ICBC, China Eximbank, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank was based on an internal rate of return (IRR) calculation of 17% (which in turn is based on the $0.17 per kWh tariff) and that it won\\u2019t be able to repay its debts if the IRR and tariff rate are downwardly revised.\",\"On May 8, 2015, China Eximbank and Vnesheconombank (VEB) \\u2014 a Russian government-owned development bank \\u2014 signed an RMB 3.9 billion credit facility (line of credit) agreement for the Electrolytic Manganese Production Plant Project. Any borrowings undertaken through the facility were expected to carry a maturity of 15 years. VEB intended to on-lend the proceeds from the facility to a project company called CJSC Chek-Su.VK, which would most likely use the on-lent proceeds to finance an EPC (commercial) contract with Sinosteel.   The purpose of the Electrolytic Manganese Production Plant Project is to build a plant for the production of electrolytic manganese in the settlement of Tuim in Khakassia. Electrolytic manganese has a purity of 99.8% and is used for production of special kinds of steel and alloys. The plant would have the capacity to produce 80,000 tons per year of manganese metal, and the output would be sold mainly on the domestic market. As of 2015, Russia\\u2019s demand for manganese metal was about 60,000 tons per year. CJSC Chek-Su.VK did not expect serious objections based on environmental concerns in Tuim because the company planned to use modern Chinese technology that has minimal environmental impact; also Tuim had an old nonferrous metals plant that used to produce rolled copper but that had recently been closed, leaving the plant\\u2019s workers unemployed.   The total cost of the project was estimated to be 40 billion rubles (about $630 million). The financing of the project was to be provided by the Export-Import Bank of China in collaboration with VEB. CJSC Chek-Su.VK stated the plant would be constructed by Sinosteel and commissioned within 45 months of the financing being received. The plant in Tuim was expected to have 1,200 employees, and another 800 people would be employed in service areas related to the plant. The plant\\u2019s annual tax payments were expected amount to 1.5 billion rubles (about $24 million).   It is unclear if this project ever entered implementation. It is also unclear if China Eximbank ever made any disbursements through the credit facility.\",\"On September 8, 2016, during Premier Li Keqiang's visit to Laos, China Eximbank and the Lao Ministry of Finance signed a $600 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the 240MW Nam Ngum 4 (NG4) Hydropower Project. \\u00c9lectricit\\u00e9 du Laos (EDL) \\u2014 the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets \\u2014 became the effective borrower of the loan. However, it is unclear if it co-signed the PBC agreement or an on-lending agreement with the Lao Ministry of Finance. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds from the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $706 million EPC contract between EDL and China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC), which was signed in late 2015.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 240MW hydropower plant with three 80MW turbines and a 74-meter high dam with water storage capacity of 107,400,000 cubic meters. The project also involves the construction of a 17 km tunnel. The project site is located approximately 10 km west of a proposed slaughterhouse site near the confluence on Nam Kho River and Nam Ngum River in Paek District and Xiangkhoang Province. Its precise locational coordinates are as follows: Latitude: 19\\u00b05'2.04\\\" and Longitude: 102\\u00b052'46.56\\u201d. CHMC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. It appears to have hired VLV Xoumphonphakdy (a Lao company) as a subcontractor. Construction began on January 25, 2018. River closure occurred on October 15, 2019. Then, on February 15, 2021, a 200 ton bridge crane at the Nam Ngum 4 Hydropower Plant successfully completed a load test. As of May 2022, the project had achieved a 90% completion rate. The expected project completion date is 2023.\",\"On December 18, 2014 and February 20, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda signed two loan agreements worth a total of $1,435,158,682 for the 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project. Then, on February 27, 2015, the Parliament of Uganda ratified these two loan agreements. The first loan agreement with China Eximbank, captured via Project ID#36211, is a buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [No. 140302052015210069] worth $645,821,407.12 that was signed on February 20, 2015 with the following borrowing terms: an annual interest rate of 3.827% (LIBOR plus 3.5% margin), a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee ($3,229,107.04), and a 0.5% commitment fee. Under the terms of the BCL, the Government to Uganda is responsible for on-lending the full amount of the loan to Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL). The second China Eximbank loan agreement, captured via Project ID#30919, is a preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC (2014) 46 TOTAL NO. (340)] worth $789,337,275.36 that was signed on December 18, 2014 with the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 0.25% management fee (worth $1,973,343.19), and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the BCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost of a $1,688,421,979.39 commercial contract between the Government of Uganda\\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and Sinohydro Corporation Limited, which was signed on August 16, 2013 and amended on May 6, 2014 and May 15, 2014 (via Addendum No. 1 and Addendum No. 2). The borrower was to use the BCL proceeds to finance 38.25% of the commercial contract cost and the PBC proceeds to finance 46.75% of the commercial contract cost.   The Government of Uganda provided a sovereign guarantee for both China Eximbank loans, and the Government of Uganda was obligated under the terms of these loans to open escrow accounts with Stanbic Bank and deposit funds in the accounts over the terms of the loans to facilitate repayment and provide security in the event of default. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of one of these escrow (repayment reserve) accounts was UGX 87,154,247,132 ($26,146,274.13).  UMEME Ltd. became the major privately owned electricity distributor in Uganda in 2005 after winning a 20-year concession to operate UEDCL's main distribution network. It was involved as a contractual signatory to the Karuma PPA in order to safeguard the repayment mechanism and avoid potential risks of revenues being misallocated. Loan repayments to China Eximbank were to be made through electricity payments under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with UETCL and UMEME Ltd. According to the terms of the loan agreements and the PPA, UEGCL was to supply UETCL all available power capacity on \\u201ctake or pay\\u201d basis, which means that UETCL was responsible for paying for all available electricity generated by the dam, and not only what was needed. However, in 2019, Uganda\\u2019s Auditor General discovered that the generation and sales licenses were in contradiction of the PPA and loan agreements because they stated that \\u201cthe tariff methodology [will] be based on the energy service cost implying that the energy dispatch to UETCL will be influenced by market demand.\\u201d   According to the Government of Uganda\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the PBC achieved a 85.4% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 24 loan disbursements (worth $674,527,385.55) between 2015 and 2020: a $101,179,038 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $16,324,648 disbursement on December 25, 2015, a $16,009,159 disbursement on December 28, 2015, a $23,583,642.35 disbursement on April 27, 2016, a $11,850,199 disbursement on July 29, 2016, a $37,208,639 disbursement on September 13, 2016, a $18,949,811 disbursement on December 15, 2016, a $8,637,526 disbursement on April 21, 2017, a $6,927,809 disbursement on June 27, 2016, a $43,705,347.25 disbursement on September 6, 2017, a $28,149,577.68 disbursement on October 18, 2017, a $12,649,419.75 disbursement on November 14, 2017, a $39,929,383.45 disbursement on December 26, 2017, a $48,155,261.48 disbursement on April 13, 2018, a $13,785,395.25 disbursement on May 31, 2018, a $65,799,750.54 disbursement on October 19, 2018, a $7,308,794.90 disbursement on December 25, 2018, a $41,827,450.63 disbursement on February 28, 2019, a $36,212,516.45 disbursement on April 29, 2019, a $13,979,022.20 disbursement on June 20, 2019, a $52,698,924.89 disbursement on November 13, 2019, a $10,010,402.52 disbursement on December 19, 2019, a $14,101,813.11 disbursement on March 20, 2020, and a $5,543,854.10 disbursement on August 18, 2020.   According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $674,527,385.55 and the loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $674,527,385.55.  According to the Government of Uganda\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the BCL achieved a 97% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 31 loan disbursements (worth $625,602,535.38) between 2015 and 2021: a $31,356,497 disbursement on December 25, 2015, a $30,767,223 disbursement on January 29, 2016, a $58,068,539 disbursement on March 7, 2016, a $8,341,230.65 disbursement on May 26, 2016, a $9,695,618 disbursement on July 29, 2016, a $30,443,431 disbursement on September 13, 2016, a $15,504,390 disbursement on December 15, 2016, a $7,067,066 disbursement on April 21, 2017, a $5,668,207 disbursement on June 29, 2017, a $22,395,381 disbursement on September 1, 2017, a $13,363,539.75 disbursement on September 8, 2017, a $23,031,472.65 disbursement on October 17, 2017, a $10,349,525.25 disbursement on November 15, 2017, a $32,669,495.55 disbursement on December 19, 2017, a $39,399,759.39 disbursement on April 20, 2018, a $11,278,959.75 disbursement on May 29, 2018, a $53,836,159.53 disbursement on October 18, 2018, a $5,979,923.10 disbursement on December 24, 2018, a $34,222,459.61 disbursement on March 1, 2019, a $29,628,422.56 disbursement on April 29, 2019, a $11,437,381.80 disbursement on June 19, 2019, a $43,117,302.18 disbursement on November 12, 2019, a $8,190,329.33 disbursement on December 20, 2019, a $11,537,847.09 disbursement on March 19, 2010, a $8,362,437.84 disbursement on August 19, 2020, a $16,193,030.50 disbursement on November 5, 2020, a $9,772,888.57 disbursement on August 26, 2021, a $8,920,595.93 on March 17, 2022, a $10,602,602.45 disbursement on May 9, 2022, a $14,822,335.90 disbursement on June 17, 2022, and a $9,578,484 disbursement on August 18, 2022.  According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total disbursements under the BCL amounted to $581,678,517 and the loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $517,096,376.38.   On July 28, 2021, the Government of Uganda and China Eximbank signed a supplementary agreement to the BCL agreement [ID#14030205015210069A], which extended the loan's availability (disbursement) period to allow for $73,915,778.59 of undisbursed funds to be utilized by the borrower (after the original availability period expired on December 24, 2020). The supplementary agreement also specified that, if the loan fully disbursed, the borrower would be responsible for making twenty, semi-annual repayments (worth $32,291,070.36 each) between January 21, 2021 and July 21, 2030.  The 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project., which is also known as the Karuma Hydropower Plant and Interconnection Project, will involve the installation of 6 turbines (10 million kilowatts each), which will create a total capacity of 600 MW, making it Uganda's largest power plant. After the first two turbines start generating electricity, the remaining four turbines will be turned on once per month. The project includes dams, water diversion pipes, underground power plants, and transmission lines. The purpose of the Interconnection Project is to evacuate power produced from Karuma Hydropower Plant in Northern Uganda to load centers, which include Lira and Olwiyo in Northern Uganda, and Kawanda in Central Uganda. It will involve construction of a 248km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Kawanda transmission line; a 78km, 132kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Lira Transmission Line; a 55km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Olwiyo transmission Line (which will be initially operated at 132kV); a new 400/132kV sub-station interconnecting with Karuma HPP and 400kV line bays; a new 400kV/220kV substation with two new incoming 400kV line bays to interface with the existing Kawanda 220/132kV substation; two new incoming 132kV line bays to interface with the existing Lira 132/33kV substation; and a new 132/33kV Olwiyo substation.   The EPC contractor responsible for implementation of this project was Sinohydro Corporation Limited. The construction of the dam and power station officially started on August 12, 2013. As of March 2016, about 30% of the work had been completed. In October 2016, it was estimated that about 1,000 Chinese nationals and about 5,000 Ugandans were working at the power station. As of June 2018, 56 months from the beginning of construction, an estimated 76% of the physical work had been completed. Of the 6,000 workers, 5,300 were Ugandan. As of September 2019, an estimated 95% of construction activities had been completed, which included 100% completion of the Karuma\\u2013Lira High Voltage Line, 100% of the Karuma\\u2013Kawanda High Voltage Power Line and 98% of the Karuma\\u2013Olwiyo High Voltage Line. As of December 2020, the Karuma Hydropower dam had reached a 98.7% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Kawanda transmission line had reached a 99.5% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Lira transmission line had reached a 86.4% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Olwiyo transmission line had reached a 95.5% physical progress rate, and the Karuma, Kawanda, Olwiyo, and Lira substations have reached 99.9%, 99.9%, 93% and 99% physical progress rates, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic was considered a force major event in that it constrained manufacturing and prevented the shipping of equipment and the travel of experts to facilitate the installation and commissioning of equipment. Other project implementation challenges have included a dispute between the EPC contractor and a sub-contractor, which halted the finalization of the stringing and energizing of a 2.504 km transmission line; UMEME distribution lines without required minimum clearances at Walusi, and Wabigalo; the vandalism of tower materials; accusations of public waste and corruption; the death of a worker due to allegedly unsafe work practices; and accusations that one worker was engaged in ivory smuggling activities. The cost of the project also reportedly ballooned from $1.68 billion at least $2.2 billion.\",\"In January 2016, Iran\\u2019s Deputy Minister of Road and Urban Development and Managing Director of the Construction and Development of Transportation Infrastructures Company (CDTIC), Ali Nourzad, announced that an MOU had been signed with a Chinese company for the financing of the 446 km Shiraz-Bushehr Railway Construction Project. Then, on March 7, 2018, CDTIC and China Machinery Industry Construction Group Inc. (SINOCONST) signed an Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Financing (EPCF) agreement for Section 1 of the 446 km Shiraz-Bushehr Railway Construction Project. An unspecified Chinese state-owned bank issued a loan worth RMB 4,440,000,000 to SINOCONST to facilitate the implementation of the project. The loan\\u2019s final maturity date is in 2028 (implied maturity length: 10 years). The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower expects to make payments for principal, interest, fees, and insurance worth RMB 5,914,000,000 (RMB 4,440,000,000 in principal RMB 1,474,000,000 in interest, fees, and insurance) \\u2014 in nominal terms \\u2014 over the lifetime of the loan. It is also known that the borrower expects to use the loan proceeds to partially finance the RMB 5 billion ($790 million) EPCF contract that was signed on March 7, 2018.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 250 km section of a 446 km railway that runs from Shiraz to Bushehr. The 250 km section includes 13 km of tunnels and 2,600 bridges. The project\\u2019s earthworks include 17 million cubic meters of excavation and 13 million cubic meters of embankment.   SINOCONST is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Jahanpars Engineering and Construction Company \\u2014 an Iranian subcontractor \\u2014 is also involved in the implementation of the project.

The remaining contributions to the syndicated loan came from China Minsheng Bank ($371.88 million) and Ping An Bank ($371.88 million), both of which are privately-owned Chinese banks.    The loan carries a term (maturity) of up to 15 years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.6% margin. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The proceeds of this loan were to be used by the borrower to finance up to 85% of the cost of a $4,532,114,041.00 commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with CGGC-Niara \\u2014 a joint venture of China Gezhouba Group Corporation (60% stake), Boreal Investments Limited (37.5% stake), and NIARA Holding (2.5% stake) \\u2014 signed on June 11, 2015. As of December 31, 2021, the $4.1 billion syndicated loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate.   The project involves the construction of 2171 MW Caculo Caba\\u00e7a Hydroelectric Power Station, which is located at the village of S\\u00e3o Pedro da Quilemba, near the city of Dondo, in Cuanza Norte Province. This location is approximately 195 kilometers (121 mi), by road, southeast of Luanda, the capital and largest city of Angola. The project has three main components: temporary river diversion works, main construction works, and the supply of electromechanical equipment. The main dam will be 103 meters (338 ft) in height, with crest width of 553 meters (1,814 ft), creating a reservoir lake that measures 16.3 kilometers (10 mi) in length, with a surface area of 16.6 square kilometers (6 sq mi).  Upon completion, the power plant is projected to generate an average of 8,566 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7.2 million tons annually.  An official inauguration ceremony marking the beginning of construction was held on August 4, 2017. Construction was originally expected to last 80 months, so project completion was scheduled for April 2024. However, the project subsequently encountered various delays and problems. In September 2017, a corruption investigation by Der Spiegel, the Portuguese newspaper Expresso, and European Investigative Collaborations, an independent journalism centre, revealed that the daughter of President Jos\\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, billionaire businesswoman Isabel dos Santos, is the beneficial owner of Boreal Investments Limited (a shell company that was registered in Hong Kong in 2012). Then, on November 5, 2019, the President of Angola formally authorized Presidential Order No. 79/18 (from July 12, 2019) which amended the EPC contract for the 171 MW Caculo Caba\\u00e7a Dam and Transmission Line Project by removing CGGC-Niara and Boreal Investments Limited so that \\u2018the only party to the contract is China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC)\\u2019. Then, in May 2022, there was a major labor disturbance at the project site. Protestors ransacked the management offices at the project site and the police shot three workers. The workers were reportedly angry over low wages and poor treatment by their employer (CGGC).  As of June 2020, 90% of tunneling work necessary to divert the Cuanza River to the dam had been completed and 3.47% of work on the dam itself had been completed. Then, on May 20, 2023, a ceremony was held to mark the temporary diversion of the Cuanza River, which marked the beginning of the main construction phase of the hydroelectric power project.  At that time, the project employed more than 2,500 workers, of whom more than 81 percent were local, and the connection of the first generator to the power grid was scheduled for completion by 2026.\",\"On December 5, 2016, the Government of Angola entered into a $4.1 billion syndicated loan facility agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Eximbank, China Construction Bank, Bank of China, China Minsheng Bank, and Ping An Bank for the 2,171MW Caculo Caba\\u00e7a Dam and Transmission Line Project.

(MISPI) \\u2014 a state-owned Iranian company \\u2014 for the Masjed Soleiman Petrochemical Complex Construction Project. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance an EPC contract that was issued to a consortium of firms consisting of Switzerland\\u2019s Casale SA, Japan\\u2019s Toyo Engineering Corporation, China\\u2019s Wuhan Petrochemical, and Iran\\u2019s Petrochemical Industries Design and Engineering Company (PIDEC). The purpose of the project was to construct a petrochemical plant that is capable of 660,000 tons per year of ammonia and 1,073 tons per year of urea. The plant is to be fed by 861 million cubic meters per year of natural gas (extracted from the Zilayee gas field).   The plant is located on a 400-hectare plot of land in the Zeilai (Zilayee) area within the city of \\u200b\\u200bMasjed Soleiman and Khuzestan Province. It is adjacent to Lali Road (Haft Shahidan area) and 11.5 km south of Karun River.   Construction began in 2014 and the originally anticipated project implementation end date was July 16, 2019. As of May 2018, the project had achieved a 75% completion rate. Subsequent reporting indicates that the project eventually reached a 94% completion rate and it was expected to achieve completion in February 2021.\",\"In 2017, China Development Bank (Henan Branch) signed a $650 million agreement with AviaAM Financial Leasing China (AviaAM)  \\u2014 a joint venture between AviaAM Leasing (a Warsaw Stock Exchange listed and Lithuania-headquartered aircraft leasing company) and Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Company (HNCA) \\u2014 to lease 16 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft to Aeroflot Russian Airlines. The legal adviser for the transaction was LP and King Wood Mallesons. Deliveries of the aircraft were scheduled to begin in March 2017. Four Airbus A320s were delivered in the first half of 2017, and one Airbus 321 was delivered on July 7, 2017. A sixth Airbus was delivered on August 15, 2017.  As a consequence of the February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western government issued a number of sanctions on the Russian aviation and airline industry. As a result, a number of leasing companies cancelled their lease agreements with Russian airliners. Despite the cancellations, Russia acted to seize the leased aircraft to maintain a fleet of air-worthy aircraft and prevent foreign currency outflows (since leasing contracts are denominated in United States dollars) in violation of the Cape Town Convention, an international treaty that stipulates the return of leased aircraft to their owners when contracts are cancelled. On March 14, 2022, after the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia passed a law to allow foreign-registered aircraft owned by non-Russian lessors to be placed on the Russian registry, making it likely that leasing companies would be unable to recover their assets. 10 Airbus A320-214 aircraft and three Airbus A321-211 owned by AviaAM Financial Leasing China \\u2014 possibly including the 16 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft leased under the 2017 agreement to Aeroflot and/or the eight leased under another 2017 agreement to Aeroflot (Project ID#67101) \\u2014 were re-registered in Russia, making it likely that ICBC Leasing would fail to recover its aircraft.\",\"On October 30, 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $500 million buyer's credit loan (BCL) facility agreement with Telemar Norte Leste SA (TMAR), a Brazil-based telecommunications company and subsidiary of Oi SA.

Then, on March 12, 2010, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and a consortium of Chinese enterprises (consisting of China Railway Resources Group Co., Ltd and PowerChina Resources Limited) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) \\u2014 known in French as \\u2018Le Protocole d'accord en vue de la Construction de la Centrale Hydroelectrique de Busanga a Kolwezi au Katanga\\u2019 \\u2014 regarding the 240 MW Busanga Hydropower Plant Project. 11 months later, on February 18, 2011, Sinohydro Corporation Limited signed an EPC contract with Sino\\u2013Congolais des Mines (Sicomines) \\u2014 a joint venture between several Chinese firms and la G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale des Carri\\u00e8res et des Mines (G\\u00e9camines) \\u2014 for the 240 MW Busanga Hydropower Plant Project in Katanga Province. Then, on July 4, 2016, a joint venture and special purpose vehicle known as Sino-Congolaise Hydro\\u00e9lectrique (Sicohydro) was created by Sicomines (75% ownership stake), G\\u00e9camines (7% ownership stake), la Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Nationale d\\u2019Electricit\\u00e9 (SNEL, 3% ownership stake), and Congo Management Sarl (COMAN, 15% ownership stake). In August 23, 2016, DRC\\u2019s Minister of Energy and Water Resources Jeannot Matadi Nenga signed a concession agreement with Sicohydro to implement the project on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis. According to Mo\\u00efse Ekanga Lushyma, the Executive Secretary of the Bureau for Coordination and Monitoring of the Sino-Congolese Program (BCPSC), the project was originally going to be funded with $330 million from a \\u201cmining investment loan\\u201d that was issued to Sicomines and $330 million from an \\u201cinfrastructure loan\\u201d that was issued to Sicomines. However, Sicohydro ultimately contracted a $660 million commercial loan in 2016 (with a 6.1% interest rate) from China Eximbank to finance the construction of the hydroelectric power plant.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 240 MW hydroelectric power plant near the village of Busanga in Katanga Province on the Lualaba River. The project is expected upon completion to supply up to 170 MW of its 240 MW electricity production capacity to the Sicomines-managed copper mines (see more details in Project ID#450). The project also involves the construction of a \\u00b1500 kV, 13.15 km UHVDC electricity transmission line to evacuate power from the hydroelectric power plant. Once the hydroelectric power plant and transmission line are compete, the Sicomine copper mine in Kolwezi is expected to double its annual production of copper, which in principle would unlock more resources through the $2 billion \\u2018infrastructure loan\\u2019 from China Eximbank captured via Project ID#73145. Sinohydro Corporation Limited is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   In July 2015, the DRC\\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Hydraulic Resources examined the project\\u2019s feasibility study report and issued a document for its approval.  Then, in February 2016, an Environmental Certificate was issued for the project by the Congolese Environment Agency (ACE). A formal groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 6, 2016. However, construction of the dam did not begin until November 20, 2017. River closure was achieved on August 25, 2018. Construction of a \\u00b1500 kV, 13.15 km UHVDC electricity transmission line to evacuate power from Busanga dam began on May 17, 2019. The line became operational on November 6, 2020.  The hydropower station officially began water storage in May 2021, which represented a key milestone prior to power generation. By September 2021, the project as a whole had achieved a 95% completion rate. Then, in January 2022, the concrete pouring of the dam crests on the left and right banks of the hydropower station was completed. The project was originally expected to be officially commissioned on November 20, 2021. However, as of May 2022, the hydropower station had not yet been commissioned. The 240 MW Busanga Hydroelectric Power Plant Project has encountered several different problems and controversies.   On July 17, 2020, the provincial minister of the interior of Lualaba asked residents of four villages in Busanga (Kamalenge, Monga Lubuza and Wafinya) who had already received compensation to release their homes by July 29, 2020 to allow Sicohydro to dig the basins useful for the dam\\u2019s operation. Eleven civil society organizations called for a postponement of the deadline to reach a final and satisfactory compromise for all parties. The 240 MW Busanga Hydropower Plant Project has also been plagued by accusations of corruption. In 2018, reports emerged that Sicohydro had a a \\\"phantom\\\" (15%) shareholder (Congo Management Sarl, or Coman) with close ties to people in President Kabila\\u2019s entourage. Coman was represented by Norbert Nkulu, a close adviser and personal lawyer to President Kabila.  Nkulu also served as a legal representative for a port operations company majority-owned by President Kabila and his family that received $3.3 million in misappropriated public funds through its accounts at BGFIBank DRC. Coman\\u2019s director was Claudine Paony, a Congolese government officially who worked for Mo\\u00efse Ekanga Lushyma, the Executive Secretary of the Bureau for Coordination and Monitoring of the Sino-Congolese Program (BCPSC). According to an investigation by The Sentry, communications at BGFIBank DRC indicate Paony received as much as $662,500 from Congo Construction Company (CCC)\\u2014a shell company created by a Chinese national names Du Wei in December 2012\\u2014in early 2014. Also, according to the Sentry, Sicomines sent three payments totaling $25 million to the bank accounts of CCC at BGFIBank DRC, and CCC then immediately routed the vast majority of these funds to companies and people associated with President Kabila. The remittance information\\u2014\\u201ccontract costs,\\u201d \\u201cpayment\\u201d\\u2014offered no details on the purposes of the sizable transfers, and BGFIBank DRC\\u2019s internal auditors were later unable to locate any contract underlying the payments. Citibank in New York processed at least $17 million of the money Sicomines sent to CCC.   In 2016, Sicomines wired CCC approximately $8 million. Citibank processed the transaction in New York. The bare-bones remittance information was \\u201ccontract costs,\\u201d even though evidence suggests this was a fictional pretext and there was no such contract in existence. That day, CCC transferred about $7.5 million to another BGFIBank DRC client called Sud Oil and moved the remaining half a million dollars to accounts in Du Wei\\u2019s name in Hong Kong and the DRC, via ING Belgium and HSBC. The justification for the Sud Oil transfer was the purchase of \\u201cpetroleum products.\\u201d Despite its name, Sud Oil was a Kabila family enterprise that no longer had any connection to the petroleum sector. BGFIBank DRC\\u2019s longtime board president Pascal Kinduelo had originally established Sud Oil as a fuel distribution firm in 2008 but reportedly divested three years later, selling off all of the company\\u2019s assets. Sud Oil gained new life in late 2013 when it was re-registered under the ownership of Kabila family member Gloria Mteyu, co-owner of BGFIBank DRC, and Aneth Lutale, Kabila\\u2019s sister-in-law and wife of BGFIBank DRC Managing Director Francis Selemani.  According to sources consulted by The Sentry, the newly registered Sud Oil was a shell company with no productive assets other than its headquarters, which were situated in a garage. Experts on the oil and gas sector in the DRC told The Sentry it was implausible the company had any activity in the sector.336 Investigations by The Sentry, Congo Research Group, and other members of the Congo Hold-up consortium reinforce the notion that Sud Oil merely served as a mechanism for moving money. These investigations show that the company received at least $85 million in funds from Congolese government institutions without any reasonable justification. In 2021, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi authorized investigations of the Sicomines (minerals-for-infrastructure) deal and the Busanga hydroelectric power plant project.\",\"In 2018, JSC KazAvtoZhol National Company Joint Stock Company (JSC NC KazAvtoZhol or \\u0430\\u0437\\u0410\\u0432\\u0442\\u043e\\u0416\\u043e\\u043b)\\u2014 a Kazakh state-owned transportation company \\u2014 and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement worth $727,212,309 for the 326.6 km Karaganda-Balkhash Highway Reconstruction Project. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, and a 5-year grace period. The Government of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $855 million commercial (EPC) contract between CITIC Construction Co.

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR (-0.274% in November 2017) plus a 2.3% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.5% commitment fee, a 0.5% management fee, a 3.6% exposure fee, and a 5.8% insurance fee (i.e. 5.8% of the loan\\u2019s principal amount plus interest). The FBiH Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of this loan on July 10, 2018. Sinosure also provided 15 years of buyer\\u2019s credit insurance. The sovereign guarantee issued by the FBiH Ministry of Finance runs from the expiration date of the Sinosure credit insurance policy (in 2032) until the end of the loan repayment period (in 2037).   Additionally, the borrower (EPBiH) pledged all of the property \\u2014 assets and future profits \\u2014 of the Tuzla Thermal Power Plant Unit 7 (also known as \\u2018TZ B7\\u2019) as sources of collateral to China Eximbank in the event that it could not repay the loan. However, the mortgage on the TZ B7 property only applies during a five year period: from the expiration date of the Sinosure credit insurance policy (in 2032) until the end of the loan repayment period (in 2037). The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the $722,345,000 cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between EPBiH and China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. and China Energy Engineering Group Guangdong Electric Power Design Institute Co., Ltd (GEDI), which was signed on August 27, 2014.   The purpose of this project is to construct a new 450 MW unit at the Tuzla Thermal Power Plant (TPP) in the city of Tuzla and replace the capacity of the existing blocks 3, 4 and 5 and generate additional 270 MW thermal energy. Tuzla Thermal Power Plant (exact locational coordinates: 44\\u00b031\\u203212\\u2033N 18\\u00b036\\u203222\\u2033E) is a coal-fired thermal power plant in the city of Tuzla with an installed capacity of 715 MW. It is the largest power plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The construction of its blocks 1-6 was realized in stages from 1959 to 1978. TPP Tuzla produces electricity in thermoblocks 3 (100 MW), 4 (200 MW), 5 (200 MW), and 6 (215 MW); blocks 1 and 2 are permanently out of operation. The plant is supplied with coal from the Kreka-Banovi\\u0107i coal basin, the largest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has significant reserves of lignite and brown coal. The power plant takes cooling water from the Modrac Reservoir, the same source as much of the drinking water for Tuzla. This reservoir is fed mainly by the Turija River and the Spre\\u010da River; it already suffers from pollution caused by coal production and separation.   TPP Tuzla is operated by EPBiH, of which 90.369% of shares are owned by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while 9.631% are owned by private investment funds and small individual shareholders. China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. and China Energy Engineering Group Guangdong Electric Power Design Institute Co., Ltd (GEDI) are the contractors responsible for project implementation. Construction began on June 24, 2020 after a project commencement order was issued to the consortium of Chinese firms by EPBiH.   This project has become a source of controversy and scrutiny among civic monitors. The Aarhus Resource Centre, Sarajevo and CEE Bankwatch Network filed a formal complaint against the China Eximbank-financed Tuzla 7 Coal-Fired Power Plant with the EU\\u2019s Energy Community Secretariat in September 2018. One part of the complaint was that the sovereign guarantee issued by the BiH Ministry of Finance in support of the China Eximbank loan (to a BiH power utility) underestimated the true nature of its financial liability (because the environmental permit for the Tuzla 7 Coal-Fired Power Plant only requires the project owner to use the best available techniques/technologies for desulphurisation, denitrification and efficient dust filtering as of 2006 rather than 2017). The legal limits for PM2.5 (fine particles) and SO2 pollutants were breached in Tuzla during the long winter of 2017\\u20132018.   The Clean Air Movement\\u2014a group of citizens living in Tuzla concerned about the worsening health condition as a result of air pollution exposure\\u2014took to the streets to demand that authorities find long-term solutions to the problem. The air pollution reached its peak in 2018 and the beginning of 2019, with the air quality index reaching more than 500, which is by all standards hazardous for all people. Then, in June 2021, the FBiH government was informed by EPBiH that China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. had requested an amendment to its commercial contract. The FBiH government responded that changing any details of the commercial contract would involve a renegotiation process and re-approval process. The amendment request came after the US-based company General Electric (GE) canceled its subcontract with China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. The commercial contract signed by EPBiH and China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. and GEDI on August 27, 2014 specified a list of approved subcontractors, including GE (which was to supply equipment for Unit 7). GE ultimately withdrew from the project due to pressure from the European Union, which has taken a position that does not support the construction of any coal-fired power plants. Then, in December 2021, Energy Community Secretariat reportedly determined that the sovereign guarantee for the 450MW Tuzla Thermal Power Plant Unit 7 Project was issued illegally.   Under the Energy Community Treaty, FBiH must follow EU rules on subsidies in the energy sector, which stipulate that in most cases state guarantees may only cover up to 80% of the total loan amount. The sovereign guarantee for the 450MW Tuzla Thermal Power Plant Unit 7 Project, however, covers 100% of the loan amount, plus interest and other associated costs.  Despite this constraint, the FBiH House of Representatives and House of Peoples approved the sovereign guarantee for the 450MW Tuzla Thermal Power Plant Unit 7 Project on March 7, 2019, and April 1, 2019, respectively.   On July 14, 2022, the FBiH government announced that it would reject a proposal for an alternative Chinese subcontractor for the proposed Tuzla 7 coal fired power plant. This Bosnian government\\u2019s decision was based on the analysis of Slovenian experts hired by EPBiH, who delivered their conclusions at the end of May 2022, and after the country\\u2019s State Aid Council had revoked its decision to approve a sovereign guarantee for the China Eximbank loan, four years after the Council\\u2019s initial clearance. \\u2018Several factors have led to this moment \\u2013 the EU\\u2019s Energy Community Ministerial Council decision that found BiH to be in breach of the EU acquis \\u2013 the agreements entered by EU candidate countries; the subsequent recommendations by Bosnia\\u2019s State Aid Council to end state guarantees to Chinese banks; at the global level, Chinese leadership pledged to exit construction of overseas coal-fired power plants; and the two-year construction delay of Tuzla 7 due to two major Western providers of the necessary equipment deciding to stop supporting the fossil fuel industry,\\u2019 said Boris Mrkela, Campaigner at Just Finance International.\",\"On January 9, 2017, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed a syndicated loan agreement worth $1.416 billion to SK Hydro (Private) Limited (SKHPL) -- a special purpose vehicle -- for the 870.25 MW Suki Kinari Hydropower Project. Each lender reportedly contributed $708.1 million. The loan was provided on the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 12 years, a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.41326%) plus an 4.75% margin. The borrower purchased a credit insurance policy from Sinosure (at an estimated cost of $95.919 million).  SKHPL is a project company (special purpose vehicle) that was established to do finance, design, implement, and maintain the 870.25 MW Suki Kinari Hydropower Project. The shareholders of SKHPL are China Gezhouba Group International Engineering Company Limited, White Crystals Limited (a wholly owned company of Saudi Arabia\\u2019s Al Jomaih Group), Malaysia\\u2019s Eden Inc., and Pakistan\\u2019s Haseeb Khan.  This independent power project (IPP) is being implemented on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis and it was financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Equity financing for the project was arranged by the shareholders of Suki Kinari Hydro (Private) Limited. China Gezhouba Group Corporation, Al Jomaih, and Eden each invested $160.09 million USD of equity. The dam, located on River Kunhar in the District Mansehra of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, was being constructed as a 54.5 meter high and 336 meter wide concrete gravity dam with 2 gated spillways. Four 218 MW turbines were to be installed as part of the project, and were expected to generate approximately 870 MW of electricity in total. Construction of the dam was to result in the formation of a 3.1 kilometer long reservoir with a capacity of 9 million cubic meters of water. It was reportedly not planned to caused large scale displacement of populations as no villages or towns were going to be inundated by the resulting dam's reservoir, although a four kilometer section of the Kaghan-Naran highway was to be diverted as a result of construction works and the resulting reservoir.  The EPC contractor responsible for project implementation was China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. Project construction began on January 1, 2017 and was expected to reach its commercial operation date (COD) and inject 3,081 GWh million of clean reliable and affordable units of electricity each year to the national grid by December 2022. On April 25, 2019, it was reported that 70% of the project had been completed with an expected completion date in 2022. A significant milestone was held when the project held a river closure ceremony on September 28, 2019.  The project company will eventually sell all power generated to the Pakistani government \\u2014at a cost of 8.8415 US cents per kilowatt hour \\u2014 under a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA). \",\"On November 4, 2010, Bank of China, China Development Bank, and China Merchants Bank signed a $591 million syndicated loan agreement with CamGSM Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Royal Group of Companies (Cambodia\\u2019s largest private conglomerate) and owner of the MobiTel and Cellcard mobile brands. The loan carried a 7-year maturity and an unknown interest rate.  The syndicated loan was divided into two tranches with $421 million of the loan proceeds being used by the borrower for the refinancing of a bridge loan from Standard Bank and ANZ ($346 million) as well as an earlier loan arranged by International Finance Corp in 2008 ($75 million). The refinancing deal will enable The Royal Group to refinance a $421 million loan used to buy out the 100 percent majority stake (purchase included 61.5% of shares) in Mobitel from Luxembourg-based Millicom International Cellular S.A. (\\u201cMillicom\\u201d) on November 26, 2009.  The remaining $170.1 million of the loan proceeds being used by the borrower for capital expenditures and business activities (through a working capital facility). Part of the working capital facility proceeds were reportedly used to fund a 5-year $500 million services and equipment contract with Huawei.  In January 2011, Royal Group of Companies Chief Financial Officer Mark Hanna confirmed that the 18-month bridge loan from Standard Bank and ANZ had been repaid in full, four months earlier than was required.\",\"On July 29, 2010, the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) entered into a joint venture agreement with Rio Tinto and its affiliate for the development and operation of the Simandou Iron Ore Mining Project, a premium open-pit iron ore mine located in Guinea. Chalco Iron Ore \\u2014 a subsidiary of Aluminum Corporation of China \\u2014 holds 47% of the equity interest in Simfer Jersey, which in turn holds 95% equity interest in Simfer S.A (the project company responsible for the Simandou Iron Ore Mining Project). Rio Tinto holds 53% of the equity interest in Simfer Jersey (see Project #191).   Then, on April 19, 2012, Chalco Hong Kong \\u2014 a subsidiary wholly owned by Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) \\u2014 signed a $702 million loan facility agreement with China Development Bank (CDB). This loan carried an interest rate of Libor plus a 0.9% margin. As of December 31, 2012, the loan\\u2019s outstanding (principal) amount was $438,750,000. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to facilitate the long-term shareholding investment for Chalco Iron Ore in the Simandou Iron Ore Mining Project (i.e. to support Chalco Hong Kong\\u2019s capital contribution in Chalco Iron Ore).   This project has been plagued by controversy and the Simandou mine is still not operational. In November 2016, Rio Tinto admitted to paying $10.5 million to Fran\\u00e7ois de Combret, a close adviser of President Alpha Cond\\u00e9, in 2011 to obtain rights to the Simandou mine. During the same month, Rio Tinto agreed to sell its remaining equity stake in the mine to Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd. (Chinalco) for $1.3 billion. President Cond\\u00e9 denied knowing about the bribe. However, according to recordings presented by FRANCE 24, the Guinean authorities knew about the bribe.\",\"On January 23, 2019, the State of Niger and the Republic of Benin signed a bilateral agreement on the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project. Then, on August 5, 2019, the Republic of Benin entrusted the financing, construction, and operation of the Benin section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline to a special purpose vehicle known as the West African Oil Pipeline (B\\u00e9nin) Company S.A. [WAPCO B\\u00e9nin or \\u897f\\u975e\\u539f\\u6cb9\\u7ba1\\u9053\\uff08\\u8d1d\\u5b81\\uff09\\u80a1\\u4efd\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8 in Chinese]. The total cost of the Benin Section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project is $1.05 billion (CFAF 608 billion) and it is being financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. CNPC Finance (HK) Limited (CPFHK) \\u2014 a subsidiary of the\\u00a0China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) \\u2014 issued a loan worth an estimated $840 million to WAPCO B\\u00e9nin for the Benin Section of the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project. The loan\\u2019s estimated interest rate is 8.05%. The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.  The purpose of the project is to construct the 675 km Benin section of the 1,980 km Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline, which connects Niger's Agadem Rift Basin to the Port of S\\u00e8m\\u00e8 export terminal in the town of S\\u00e8m\\u00e8-Kpodji. The Benin section of the pipeline consists of a 660 km overland subsection and a 15 km underwater subsection. The project scope also includes the construction of two pumping stations \\u2014 one in Gogounou and the other in Tchatchou. Upon completion, the pipeline is expected to have a capacity of 90,000 barrels per day (bpd). The Government of Benin expects to receive $884.6 million in transit fees during the pipeline\\u2019s period of operation and $109 million in tax revenues (VAT and other fees and taxes). The construction of the pipeline is also expected to generate additional traffic to the Port of Cotonou in Benin. The port is expected to process up to 300,000 tons of goods once the pipeline becomes operational.  China Petroleum Planning and Engineering Institute (CPPEI) and the China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering (CPPE) are the contractors responsible for project implementation. The project was originally scheduled to commence on March 15, 2020. However, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, construction did not begin until May 20, 2021. The pipeline was originally scheduled for completion in January 2022. On October 14, 2022, Chinese state-owned broadcaster CGTN referred to the Niger-Benin Oil Pipeline Construction Project as \\u2018an integral part of China\\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative.\\u2019 The Niger section of the project had achieved a 30% completion rate as of October 2022 (see Project ID#58435).\",\"In June 2015, TRX City Sdn Bhd (TRXC)\\u2014 a wholly owned subsidiary of Malaysia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance \\u2014 launched an international request for proposals (RP) to source investors for the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. IWH-CREC Sdn Bhd (ICSB) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Sdn BHd (IWH) [60% ownership stake] and China Railway Engineering Corp (M) Sdn Bhd (CREC) [40% ownership stake] \\u2014 was the winning bidder. On December 31, 2015, 1MDB \\u2014 a Malaysia state investment fund \\u2014 signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with ICSB for the sale of 60% equity in Bandar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (BMSB). As part of this agreement, ICSB paid a 10% (RM 741 million) deposit, which was channelled to 1MDB (the parent company of TRXC at the time) to help it meet its outstanding debt obligations. ICSB valued 100% of Bandar Malaysia's land at RM 12.35 billion, and by extension, 60% of its land at RM 7.41 billion.   Then, on June 16, 2016, Bank of China (BOC), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and China Construction Bank (CCB) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) expressing their intent in providing a loan to ICSB for the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. During the same month, BOC, ICBC, and CCB signed a syndicated overseas investment loan agreement with ICSB worth RM 3 billion to facilitate its acquisition of a 60% equity stake in BMSB and finance associated project costs. The loan carried a 5-year maturity, but its interest rate and grace period are unknown. ICBC served as the mandated lead arranger of the syndicated loan. On June 16, 2016, CREC also agreed to make a $2 billion investment in ICSB (captured via Project ID#70527).   However, on May 3, 2017, TRXC notified ICSB that it had failed to meet the requirements of the agreement reached on December 31, 2015 and the acquisition was being terminated. TRXC refunded the RM 741 million deposit. Malaysia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance had to step in to advance the amount to TRXC as the funds were earlier used to pay 1MDB obligations. Then, in June 2017, Malaysia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) for Fortune 500 companies or international real estate companies to take on the role of master developer of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. However, a qualified company was not identified.   Then, on April 25, 2019, during the second \\u201cBelt and Road\\u201d International Cooperation Summit Forum, witnessed by the prime ministers of China and Malaysia, CREC President Zhang Zongyan and Malaysian Minister of Economic Affairs Azmin Azmin signed a framework agreement for the \\u2018restoration\\u2019 of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. Two days later, on April 27, 2019, CREC announced that it would resume its participation in the acquisition of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project and maintain the original purchase price and shareholding structure. Then, on December 17, 2019, TRXC sold a 60% equity stake in BMSB to ICSB for RM 7.41 billion after the parties inked a restated shared and amended share sale agreement and shareholder agreement.  The purpose of the Bandar Malaysia project is to construct 10,000 affordable housing units on a 486-acre site and an 85-acre park for the public. The project site is located in the the heart of Kuala Lumpur at the site of Royal Malaysian Air Force base on Jalan Sg Besi. The project officially commenced on April 1, 2017. Project implementation was delayed in May 2017 due to a contractual dispute. The project was restarted in April 2019. On May 6, 2021, IWH-CREC and Malaysia's Ministry of finance jointly agreed to terminate their contract due to an inability to agree on preceding conditions for the project. The project is expected to continue but not with CREC-funding. \",\"On December 18, 2014 and February 20, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda signed two loan agreements worth a total of $1,435,158,682 for the 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project. Then, on February 27, 2015, the Parliament of Uganda ratified these two loan agreements. The first loan agreement with China Eximbank, captured via Project ID#36211, is a buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [No. 140302052015210069] worth $645,821,407.12 that was signed on February 20, 2015 with the following borrowing terms: an annual interest rate of 3.827% (LIBOR plus 3.5% margin), a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee ($3,229,107.04), and a 0.5% commitment fee. Under the terms of the BCL, the Government to Uganda is responsible for on-lending the full amount of the loan to Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL). The second China Eximbank loan agreement, captured via Project ID#30919, is a preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC (2014) 46 TOTAL NO. (340)] worth $789,337,275.36 that was signed on December 18, 2014 with the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 0.25% management fee (worth $1,973,343.19), and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the BCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost of a $1,688,421,979.39 commercial contract between the Government of Uganda\\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and Sinohydro Corporation Limited, which was signed on August 16, 2013 and amended on May 6, 2014 and May 15, 2014 (via Addendum No. 1 and Addendum No. 2). The borrower was to use the BCL proceeds to finance 38.25% of the commercial contract cost and the PBC proceeds to finance 46.75% of the commercial contract cost.   The Government of Uganda provided a sovereign guarantee for both China Eximbank loans, and the Government of Uganda was obligated under the terms of these loans to open escrow accounts with Stanbic Bank and deposit funds in the accounts over the terms of the loans to facilitate repayment and provide security in the event of default. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of one of these escrow (repayment reserve) accounts was UGX 87,154,247,132 ($26,146,274.13).  UMEME Ltd. became the major privately owned electricity distributor in Uganda in 2005 after winning a 20-year concession to operate UEDCL's main distribution network. It was involved as a contractual signatory to the Karuma PPA in order to safeguard the repayment mechanism and avoid potential risks of revenues being misallocated. Loan repayments to China Eximbank were to be made through electricity payments under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with UETCL and UMEME Ltd. According to the terms of the loan agreements and the PPA, UEGCL was to supply UETCL all available power capacity on \\u201ctake or pay\\u201d basis, which means that UETCL was responsible for paying for all available electricity generated by the dam, and not only what was needed. However, in 2019, Uganda\\u2019s Auditor General discovered that the generation and sales licenses were in contradiction of the PPA and loan agreements because they stated that \\u201cthe tariff methodology [will] be based on the energy service cost implying that the energy dispatch to UETCL will be influenced by market demand.\\u201d   According to the Government of Uganda\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the PBC achieved a 85.4% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 24 loan disbursements (worth $674,527,385.55) between 2015 and 2020: a $101,179,038 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $16,324,648 disbursement on December 25, 2015, a $16,009,159 disbursement on December 28, 2015, a $23,583,642.35 disbursement on April 27, 2016, a $11,850,199 disbursement on July 29, 2016, a $37,208,639 disbursement on September 13, 2016, a $18,949,811 disbursement on December 15, 2016, a $8,637,526 disbursement on April 21, 2017, a $6,927,809 disbursement on June 27, 2016, a $43,705,347.25 disbursement on September 6, 2017, a $28,149,577.68 disbursement on October 18, 2017, a $12,649,419.75 disbursement on November 14, 2017, a $39,929,383.45 disbursement on December 26, 2017, a $48,155,261.48 disbursement on April 13, 2018, a $13,785,395.25 disbursement on May 31, 2018, a $65,799,750.54 disbursement on October 19, 2018, a $7,308,794.90 disbursement on December 25, 2018, a $41,827,450.63 disbursement on February 28, 2019, a $36,212,516.45 disbursement on April 29, 2019, a $13,979,022.20 disbursement on June 20, 2019, a $52,698,924.89 disbursement on November 13, 2019, a $10,010,402.52 disbursement on December 19, 2019, a $14,101,813.11 disbursement on March 20, 2020, and a $5,543,854.10 disbursement on August 18, 2020.

According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total disbursements under the BCL amounted to $581,678,517 and the loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $517,096,376.38.   On July 28, 2021, the Government of Uganda and China Eximbank signed a supplementary agreement to the BCL agreement [ID#14030205015210069A], which extended the loan's availability (disbursement) period to allow for $73,915,778.59 of undisbursed funds to be utilized by the borrower (after the original availability period expired on December 24, 2020). The supplementary agreement also specified that, if the loan fully disbursed, the borrower would be responsible for making twenty, semi-annual repayments (worth $32,291,070.36 each) between January 21, 2021 and July 21, 2030.  The 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project., which is also known as the Karuma Hydropower Plant and Interconnection Project, will involve the installation of 6 turbines (10 million kilowatts each), which will create a total capacity of 600 MW, making it Uganda's largest power plant. After the first two turbines start generating electricity, the remaining four turbines will be turned on once per month. The project includes dams, water diversion pipes, underground power plants, and transmission lines. The purpose of the Interconnection Project is to evacuate power produced from Karuma Hydropower Plant in Northern Uganda to load centers, which include Lira and Olwiyo in Northern Uganda, and Kawanda in Central Uganda. It will involve construction of a 248km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Kawanda transmission line; a 78km, 132kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Lira Transmission Line; a 55km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Olwiyo transmission Line (which will be initially operated at 132kV); a new 400/132kV sub-station interconnecting with Karuma HPP and 400kV line bays; a new 400kV/220kV substation with two new incoming 400kV line bays to interface with the existing Kawanda 220/132kV substation; two new incoming 132kV line bays to interface with the existing Lira 132/33kV substation; and a new 132/33kV Olwiyo substation.   The EPC contractor responsible for implementation of this project was Sinohydro Corporation Limited. The construction of the dam and power station officially started on August 12, 2013. As of March 2016, about 30% of the work had been completed. In October 2016, it was estimated that about 1,000 Chinese nationals and about 5,000 Ugandans were working at the power station. As of June 2018, 56 months from the beginning of construction, an estimated 76% of the physical work had been completed. Of the 6,000 workers, 5,300 were Ugandan. As of September 2019, an estimated 95% of construction activities had been completed, which included 100% completion of the Karuma\\u2013Lira High Voltage Line, 100% of the Karuma\\u2013Kawanda High Voltage Power Line and 98% of the Karuma\\u2013Olwiyo High Voltage Line. As of December 2020, the Karuma Hydropower dam had reached a 98.7% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Kawanda transmission line had reached a 99.5% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Lira transmission line had reached a 86.4% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Olwiyo transmission line had reached a 95.5% physical progress rate, and the Karuma, Kawanda, Olwiyo, and Lira substations have reached 99.9%, 99.9%, 93% and 99% physical progress rates, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic was considered a force major event in that it constrained manufacturing and prevented the shipping of equipment and the travel of experts to facilitate the installation and commissioning of equipment. Other project implementation challenges have included a dispute between the EPC contractor and a sub-contractor, which halted the finalization of the stringing and energizing of a 2.504 km transmission line; UMEME distribution lines without required minimum clearances at Walusi, and Wabigalo; the vandalism of tower materials; accusations of public waste and corruption; the death of a worker due to allegedly unsafe work practices; and accusations that one worker was engaged in ivory smuggling activities. The cost of the project also reportedly ballooned from $1.68 billion at least $2.2 billion.\",\"In June 2014, it was announced that Pan-Mediterranean Engineering Company (PMEC) -- a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of China Harbour Engineering Company - won a tender to build the Ashdod Port Southern Terminal (\\u05e0\\u05de\\u05dc \\u05d4\\u05d3\\u05e8\\u05d5\\u05dd) in Israel with a 3.35 billion NIS bid. The port, one of Israel's largest, was located in Ashdod, about 40 kilometers south of Tel Aviv, adjoining the mouth of the Lachish River. An Israeli state-owned enterprise (SOE), the Israel Ports & Assets Company Ltd., was responsible for overseeing the implementation of the project and eventually assuming responsibility for the property and assets constructed by PMEC.  The Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) identifies this project on its website in a long list of other projects that it is financing with loans. However, it is not clear when China Eximbank issued a loan for this project. The face value, borrower, and borrowing terms of the loan are also unknown. China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) did issue buyer\\u2019s credit insurance for up to $948 million to the borrower. According to the Chinese Government, the monetary value of the commercial contract for the Ashdod Port Southern Terminal Construction Project was approximately $950 million (with a total contract period is 93 months).  The port was developed under a build, operate, and transfer (BOT) process as part of a 25-year concession. The port's eventual operator  was to complete the terminal development and then equip, operate, and maintain the port for the duration of the contract period. The project was divided into three subprojects: the breakwater project, the dredging project, and the wharf project. More specifically, the project involved the construction of a wharf with a total shoreline length of 2,363 meters project. It also involved the building of an 800-meter long main quay with a water depth of 17.3m, an extension of the port\\u2019s existing main breakwater by 600 meters, the building of 1,500 meters of secondary breakwaters, the dredging of the port, and the construction of storage and operating spaces.  Upon completion, it was expected that the southern terminal would the capacity to handle 1 to 2.16 million TEU (20-foot standard containers) annually. The facilities were built on reclaimed land, and were planned to handle Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC) 18,000+ TEU vessels.  The port was one of the biggest investment projects in Israel, as well as one of the largest harbor construction projects contracted to a Chinese company. The southern terminal was to be Israel's first privatized port and was expected to connect Israel with international trade routes between Asia and Europe. 90% of Israeli international trade went through its seaports, but Israel lacked the capacity to handle the largest vessels; the new port was designed to accommodate these larger ships. Moreover, the new port was expected to be more competitive and efficient than Israel's existing state-controlled ports in Ashdod and Haifa. Overall, the port was expected to improve Israel's economic development and trade, as well as herald in a new era of Sino-Israeli cooperation. In addition to PMEC, China Communications Second Navigation Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd. was subcontracted to support the project implementation. Chinese state-owned construction machinery company Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group Co., Ltd. (XCMG) provided a 800t XGC800 crawler crane, as well as other construction equipment for hosting ripraps and Antifer-blocks (concrete blocks to guard against waves) for project implementation.  The cornerstone for the seaport was laid on October 28, 2014, in the presence of the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. At the time, the port was expected to begin operations in 2021. Despite reports from Chinese sources that the project faced challenges in hydraulic engineering, the adoption of European, American, and Israeli standards, the local climate, the environmental impact, noise concerns from local residents, as well as its expansive scale. Nonetheless, CHEC-PMEC made good progress by innovating, including independently developing the world's first platform jackup rig specifically designed for offshore gravel pile construction. As of July 2019, the project was still expected to be completed in 2021. The port was still ongoing as of April 2021. However, in 2022, the main part of the reconstruction project of Pier 21 in Ashdod Port, Israel, undertaken by Pan-Mediterranean Engineering Company, was completed ahead of schedule and put into operation.  Dutch firm Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Swiss firm Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), won the Israeli government tender to operate the Ashdod\\u2019s Southern Terminal for 25 years following the completion of its construction.\",\"On April 26, 2019, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan (DBK) signed an $800 million term facility agreement with China Development Bank for the Aktogay Copper Mine Expansion Project. DBK then on-lent the proceeds of the loan to a special purpose vehicle called\\u00a0KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP (which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC). The facility (loan) agreement between DBK and KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP was signed on June 14, 2019. The loan matures on November 26, 2034, and bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a 2.2% margin. In November 2019 and December 2019, DBK drew down two tranches of $140 million and $60 million, respectively, and in April 2020 and October 2020, DBK drew down further tranches of $80 million and $100 million, respectively, under the facility (loan) agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the CDB facility agreement was $380 million.   The purpose of this project is to expand the Aktogay mining and processing plant (MPP). In February 2021, KAZ Minerals PLC announced that construction works at the Aktogay copper mine expansion project in Kazakhstan were affected by reduced staff availability in the first half of 2020, however, works progressed according to plan in the second half of the year as COVID-19 related restrictions were eased and the group\\u2019s testing and isolation measures enabled shift changes to take place safely.   On June 4, 2021, a sub-loan agreement was signed between Kazakhstan Development Bank and China Development Bank in the amount of $217 million in order to finance the investment project \\u201cConstruction and operation of a complex for processing gold-bearing primary ores with a capacity of 5 million tons per year\\u201d by RG Processing LLP, RG Gold LLP. As of January 1, 2022, $56.5 million has been disbursed through this loan.   Aktogay is a large-scale, open pit mine with a remaining mine life of around 25 years (including the expansion project) at an average copper grade of 0.27% (oxide) and 0.33% (sulphide). It was forecast to produce about 100,000 tons of copper from sulphide ore in 2021, increasing to over 170,000 tons per year from 2022 to 2027 after the second concentrator commences operations. The expansion project is expected to double sulphide ore capacity from 25 metric tons to 50 metric tons per year and add 80,000 tons of annual copper production from 2022-27 (and about 60,000 tons per year from 2028 onwards). \",\"In October 2013, China Development Bank signed an $800 million loan agreement with Vnesheconombank (VEB) for the construction of a multipurpose complex in Moscow. The loan has a maturity of 6 years. The interest rate and grace period of the loan are unknown. The loan agreement was signed at the same time as a CDB loan agreement for the Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Plant in Kazakhstan (see Project ID#53544).   The complex is located on the territory of the former \\\"Slava\\\" clocks factory near Moscow's Belorusskiy Vokzal train station. This factory was demolished in November 2008. The Chinese sources indicate that the multifunctional complex involves some type of science and technology park (\\u83ab\\u65af\\u79d1\\u201c\\u5149\\u8363\\u201d\\u79d1\\u6280\\u56ed\\u533a), while Russian sources refer to it as a multifunctional complex for business centers (\\u0410\\u0434\\u043c\\u0438\\u043d\\u0438\\u0441\\u0442\\u0440\\u0430\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u043e \\u0434\\u0435\\u043b\\u043e\\u0432\\u044b\\u0435 \\u0446\\u0435\\u043d\\u0442\\u0440\\u044b).   The contractor responsible for implementation is MR Group. The Moscow Multifunctional Complex Construction Project appears to be nearing implementation. It has been designed by a British architect named Philip Ball and it has undergone architectural review. However, it is not clear if construction has begun. The complex, which will occupy an area of 479,715 square meters, is scheduled for commissioning in 2015.\",\"In 2017, the Export-Import Bank of China and JSC KazAutoZhol National Company Joint Stock Company (JSC NC KazAutoZhol or \\u0430\\u0437\\u0410\\u0432\\u0442\\u043e\\u0416\\u043e\\u043b)\\u2014 a Kazakh state-owned transportation company \\u2014 signed a $796 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the 763 km Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project. The PBC (loan) carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 5-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity. The Government of Kazakhstan\\u2019s Ministry of Finance provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan on April 24, 2017. The loan then legally entered into force in June 2017. The proceeds of the PBC are to be used by the borrower to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $936 million commercial (EPC) contract between CITIC Construction Co., Ltd and KazAvuoZhol, which was signed in May 2016.   The purpose of the project is to reconstruct a 763.5 km long segment of Kazakhstan's national highway network, stretching from Taldykorgan (Taldy-Korgan) \\u2014 the capital of Almaty oblast \\u2014 to Oskemen (formerly Ust-Kamenogorsk), which is the administrative capital of the East Kazakhstan oblast. The project will seek to widen the carriageway by up to 9 meters, and facilitate traffic at a speed limit of up to 120 km/h.   CITIC Construction Co., Ltd is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, Todini Central Asia LLP and JSC K-Dorstroy are also involved in implementation. On June 7, 2017, CITIC Construction Co., Ltd accepted an order from the Government of Kazakhstan to commence work. The contract period was 54 months. Construction began in November 2017. By the end of 2018, the project had achieved a 8% completion rate. As of the end of 2020, the project had achieved a 31% completion rate. As of the end of June 2021, the project had achieve a 47% completion rate. The project was originally expected to reach completion in May 2022. \",\"On June 6, 2019, SINOPEC and SIBUR signed a framework agreement for the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project, which established a special purpose vehicle (SPV) known as Amur Gas Chemical Complex LLC (AGCC) (\\u0410\\u043c\\u0443\\u0440\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0433\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0445\\u0438\\u043c\\u0438\\u0447\\u0435\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043c\\u043f\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0441 (\\u0410\\u0413\\u0425\\u041a). AGCC is a joint venture of Sinopec (40% ownership stake and SIBUR 60% ownership stake. It secured a $1.5 billion bridge loan from a syndicated of Russian banks in December 2020.     Then, sometime between December 1-8, 2021, AGCC signed a series of syndicated loan agreements worth $9.1 billion with Chinese and non-Chinese banks for the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project: a $1.201 billion, 14-year loan from Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole Group, Intesa Sanpaolo, Citigroup, DZ Bank, Helaba, and Unicredit backed by a Euler Hermes insurance policy; a $964.36 million, 14-year loan from Unicredit, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole Group, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, and Intesa Sanpaolo backed by a SACE insurance policy; a $2.064 billion loan from Gazprombank, Sberbank, Otkritie FC Bank, and Alfa-Bank without an insurance policy; and a $4.6 billion loan from China Development Bank (CDB), China Eximbank, Bank of China (BoC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) without an insurance policy. The loan from CDB, China Eximbank, BoC, CCB, and ICBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2.6% margin, and a default (penalty) interest rate of 2%. The lenders have a formal security interest in a special bank (collateral) account, which was established on December 13, 2021 by AGCC (pledgor) and Gazprombank (account bank).  The Chinese state-owned bank contributions to the $4.6 billion syndicated loan are captured by the following Project IDs: CDB via Project ID#90926; China Eximbank via Project ID#92660, BOC via Project ID#92661, CCB via Project ID#92662, and ICBC via Project ID#92663.    The purpose of the project is to construct a petrochemical project, located in the Amur Region, close to the Chinese border in Russia. It involves the construction of a basic polymer production facility with a combined capacity of 2.7 million metric tons per year (MMt/y), comprising 2.3 MMt/y of polyethylene (PE) and 400,000 metric tons of polypropylene (PP). Upon completion, the plant will have one pyrolysis plant that can generate 2.7 million tons a year of ethylene and propylene, one plant for producing 0.4 million tons of polypropylene a year, three units producing a total of 1.8 million tons of polyethylene, one butene-1 production plant for producing 0.0555 million tons a year, 1 plant for the production of polyethylene with a capacity of 0.5 million tons per year, and OZH facilities and infrastructure.     The Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project is closely related to the Chinese bank-financed Amur Gas Processing Plant Construction Project (captured via Project ID#66306, #92611, and #92612), which will provide the raw material for the Amur Gas Chemical Complex, including two million tons of ethane fraction a year. NIPIGAS (\\u041d\\u0418\\u041f\\u0418\\u0413\\u0410\\u0417) is the general design contractor for the construction of the Amur Gas Chemical Complex.

Then, in April 2022, SIBUR and Sinopec announced plans to \\u2018revise\\u2019 their strategy for the project in the wake of new sanctions on Russia. The project\\u2019s originally expected completion date was May 2024.  There are some indications that the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways.

The project\\u2019s groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 18, 2020. By the end of March 2022, the project had achieved a completion rate of 37.8%. However, in March 2022, Linde suspended its involvement in the project after Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The project\\u2019s originally expected completion date was May 2024.  There are some indications that the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from \\u2018unfriendly states\\u2019\\u2014including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine\\u2014in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. Then, in June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.

Consequently, the SLPA commissioned at its own cost an \\u2018initial technical feasibility study\\u2019 in April 2010 for the reclamation of land south of the new breakwater. Around June 2010, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) study was commissioned by SLPA also at its own cost through the University of Moratuwa (UoM) for a reclamation area of 200 hectares. In October 2010, Sri Lanka\\u2019s Urban Development Authority (UDA) completed a master plan study based on the initial technical feasibility study and submitted a project proposal to the SLPA for consideration. Then, in April 2011, based on an unsolicited concept proposal submitted by China Communications Construction Company, Ltd. (CCCC), the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) decided to not to commit public funds to construct the CPC Project and proceeded to negotiate with CCCC to implement the project entirely as a foreign direct investment, with no financial guarantees by the GOSL on the investment.    After a 2.5 year period of negotiation with a Standing Cabinet Appointed Review Committee (SCARC) and a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) represented by 16 GOSL organizations, a Colombo Port City Franchise Agreement was signed by CHEC Port City Colombo (PVT) Ltd. \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of CCCC \\u2014 and Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) on September 16, 2014 by the Secretary to the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping (acting for and on behalf of the GOSL).

The Colombo Port City (CPC) Project is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) and Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis and financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. The $1.396 billion project is divided into two phases: the first phase investment was expected to cost $1.150 billion and the second phase investment was expected cost $246 million. On May 12, 2017, China Development Bank provided a $805 million loan to CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd. for the first phase of the project, or roughly 70% of the total cost of the first phase project of the project. The loan carries a 10-year maturity and a 3-year grace period. No sovereign guarantee was provided by the central government in support of the loan. As of September 2018, CDB had disbursed RMB 1.964 billion in support of Phase 1 of the Colombo Port City (CPC) Project.  The purpose of the phase 1 is to construct a 269-hectare artificial island and related structures. The project also involves the creation of a 5,325 meters-long breakwater that has a geometrically closed core partially consisting of sand material, rock and interlocking concrete \\u201cpods\\u201d weighing from 17 tons to 22 tons and placed in predefined lozenge-shaped grids. Upon completion, the artificial island consists of 71 million square meters of sand, with an average reclamation thickness of 20 meters. Twelve types of rock material are being used, obtained from 20 quarries located about 50 km away.    CCCC-FHDI Engineering Co., Ltd. is responsible for project design.

KCP, which is jointly owned by KTO (50% equity stake) and CNODC (50% equity stake), was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. ICBC financed the Atasu-Alashankou Section of Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project (as captured via Project ID#54527) and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol Section of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project (as captured via Project ID#54524).   However, KCP also signed a $896 million facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB). The timing and purpose of the CDB loan agreement agreement is unknown. However, it likely supported the \\u201csecond stage\\u201d of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project. The Atasu-Alshankou Section of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project was initiated on September 28, 2004 and completed December 15, 2005. The Kenkiyak-Kumkol Section of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project was initiated on December 11, 2007 and completed on October 6, 2009.   The \\u201csecond stage\\u201d of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project was initiated in 2012 and completed in 2018. It involved (a) reversing the oil pumping direction, (b) installing four additional pumping stations along the Atyrau-Kenkiyak section of the pipeline and three additional pumping stations along the Kenkiyak-Kumkol section of the pipeline, (c) increasing the capacity of the Kumkol-Karakoin section and the Karakoin-Atasu section of the pipeline, and (d) increasing the capacity of the Atasu-Alashankou section of the pipeline from 10 to 20 million tons per year. In 2012, implementation of the \\u201csecond stage\\u201d of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project commenced. Then, in 2012, the capacity of the Atasu-Alashankou section of the oil pipeline was expanded from from 10 to 20 million tons per year \\u2014 through the construction of pump station \\u21168 and pump station \\u211610 by KCP. In 2014, the Kumkol-Dzhumagaliyeva section of the oil pipeline, 199 km long, 800 mm in diameter was put into operation, the purpose of which was to increase the reliability and the capacity of the section of up to 25 MMT/y. In 2014 and 2015, pipes with a diameter of 800 mm at the exit of the OPS n.a. B. Dzhumagaliev (18 km) and at the exit of the OPS \\u00abBarsengir\\u00bb (19 km) were replaced in order to increase the reliability of the Dzhumagaliyev-Atasu section of the Pavlodar-Shymkent pipeline (taking into account the growth in oil transportation volumes). In 2016, the reconstructed OPS n.a. N.Shmanov was commissioned. Its capacity expansion made it possible to supply the Mangyshlak oil coming from the Uzen-Atyrau section of the pipeline to the Atyrau Refinery. In 2018, together with the launch of the reconstructed HOPS Kenkiyak, KazTransOil JSC completed its participation in the second stage of the Kazakhstan-China Project.\",\"On May 8, 2015, China Development Bank and Sberbank -- a Russian majority state-owned banking and financial services company headquartered in Moscow \\u2014 signed an RMB 6 billion facility agreement for trade financing purposes.

Project ID#67108 captures ICBC\\u2019s $1.239 billion contribution  to the loan syndicate. Project ID#67109 captures China Eximbank\\u2019s $909 million contribution to the loan syndicate. Project ID#67110 captures Bank of China\\u2019s $619.8 million contribution to the loan syndicate. Project ID#67111 captures China Construction Bank\\u2019s $619.8 million contribution to the loan syndicate. The remaining contributions to the syndicated loan came from China Minsheng Bank ($371.88 million) and Ping An Bank ($371.88 million), both of which are privately-owned Chinese banks.    The loan carries a term (maturity) of up to 15 years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.6% margin. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The proceeds of this loan were to be used by the borrower to finance up to 85% of the cost of a $4,532,114,041.00 commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with CGGC-Niara \\u2014 a joint venture of China Gezhouba Group Corporation (60% stake), Boreal Investments Limited (37.5% stake), and NIARA Holding (2.5% stake) \\u2014 signed on June 11, 2015. As of December 31, 2021, the $4.1 billion syndicated loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate.   The project involves the construction of 2171 MW Caculo Caba\\u00e7a Hydroelectric Power Station, which is located at the village of S\\u00e3o Pedro da Quilemba, near the city of Dondo, in Cuanza Norte Province. This location is approximately 195 kilometers (121 mi), by road, southeast of Luanda, the capital and largest city of Angola. The project has three main components: temporary river diversion works, main construction works, and the supply of electromechanical equipment. The main dam will be 103 meters (338 ft) in height, with crest width of 553 meters (1,814 ft), creating a reservoir lake that measures 16.3 kilometers (10 mi) in length, with a surface area of 16.6 square kilometers (6 sq mi).  Upon completion, the power plant is projected to generate an average of 8,566 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7.2 million tons annually.  An official inauguration ceremony marking the beginning of construction was held on August 4, 2017. Construction was originally expected to last 80 months, so project completion was scheduled for April 2024. However, the project subsequently encountered various delays and problems. In September 2017, a corruption investigation by Der Spiegel, the Portuguese newspaper Expresso, and European Investigative Collaborations, an independent journalism centre, revealed that the daughter of President Jos\\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, billionaire businesswoman Isabel dos Santos, is the beneficial owner of Boreal Investments Limited (a shell company that was registered in Hong Kong in 2012). Then, on November 5, 2019, the President of Angola formally authorized Presidential Order No. 79/18 (from July 12, 2019) which amended the EPC contract for the 171 MW Caculo Caba\\u00e7a Dam and Transmission Line Project by removing CGGC-Niara and Boreal Investments Limited so that \\u2018the only party to the contract is China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC)\\u2019. Then, in May 2022, there was a major labor disturbance at the project site. Protestors ransacked the management offices at the project site and the police shot three workers. The workers were reportedly angry over low wages and poor treatment by their employer (CGGC).  As of June 2020, 90% of tunneling work necessary to divert the Cuanza River to the dam had been completed and 3.47% of work on the dam itself had been completed. Then, on May 20, 2023, a ceremony was held to mark the temporary diversion of the Cuanza River, which marked the beginning of the main construction phase of the hydroelectric power project.  At that time, the project employed more than 2,500 workers, of whom more than 81 percent were local, and the connection of the first generator to the power grid was scheduled for completion by 2026.\",\"On November 29, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola entered into a $932 million loan (facility) agreement for the Port of Caio Construction Project. The facility has a maturity of 15 years, and the Government of Angola is not required to make any repayments under the facility until the end of the disbursement period, which ends sixty months after the effective date of the facility (meaning the grace period is 5 years). The Government of Angola did not issue a sovereign guarantee for the loan, but China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) provided an export credit insurance policy for the facility and Eximbank provided 85% of the premium. The proceeds of the loan were used to finance up to 85% of the price of a commercial contract between Caioporto, S.A. and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).  Caioporto, S.A. is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) established and owned by the Government of Angola\\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano de Angola) for the financing, construction and management of a deep-water commercial port in the village of Caio within Cabinda Province.  The only equity in this project was provided by a $180 million investment from Angola's Fundo Soberano de Angola (FSDEA) and an unknown investment amount by Quantum Global Group, an investment group founded by Swiss-Angolan Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais.  The Port of Caio Construction Project is being implemented in multiple phases.  The first phase involves the construction a 630 meter seaport wall, a 2 km bridge and access pier to the seaport terminal with 2km length, a 180 meter access channel, and a 200 meter-wide, 14 meter-deep docking basin.  The second phase involves the construction of a 200 meter-wide, 18 meter-deep access channel and a docking pier that is 1,130 meters long and 16 meters deep with the capacity to dock 4 large ships simultaneously and welcome some of the world\\u2019s largest ships.  Upon completion, the port will have the capacity to move about 60 containers per hour.  The project will cover an area of over 2,500 hectares, where customs facilities, workshops with port support and ship repair services, warehouses and commercial establishments will be built.  Phase 1 construction began in June 2017; however, as of March 2022, no funds had been disbursed through the China Eximbank facility agreement.  Then, on May 30, 2018, the contract for the project was halted by Presidential Order No. 66/18, effectively terminating the execution of the port project between Caioporto, S.A. and Angola\\u2019s Ministry of Transport. A year later, Presidential Order No. 166/19 halted the commission for the termination of the port project (in effect, undoing Presidential Order No. 66/18 and reactivating the project) and authorized the Angolan Minister of Transport to grant one of the port terminals of Porto do Caio to Caioporto, S.A. to guarantee the implementation of the project. Presidential Order No. 166/19 also made Caioporto, S.A. entirely owned by the Government of Angola\\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano de Angola) after Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais (who was removed from his position at Fundo Soberano de Angola on suspicions of financial mismanagement) returned his assets to the Angolan Government.  Construction was halted again in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic but it resumed in August 2020. Dredging activity resumed on September 13, 2022. \",\"On September 28, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed a $984.23 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the 700MW Zungeru Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The PBC (loan) carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The loan\\u2019s final maturity date is September 21, 2033. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria\\u2019s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 57.14% disbursement rate ($562.47 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $26.36 million and no principal repayments to the lender. As such, the loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $562.47 million. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 75% of a $1.293 billion commercial contract between the Government of Nigeria and a consortium consisting of Sinohydro and China National Electric Engineering Co (CNEEC), which was signed on October 19, 2012. The Government of Nigeria agreed to directly finance the remaining 25% of the commercial contract cost.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 700WM hydroelectric power plant \\u2014 with four, 175MW power generators \\u2014 on the Kaduna River in Niger State (exact locational coordinates: 9.90091, 6.28723). The project also involves the construction of a dam, electricity transmission lines, and associated substations to evacuate power from the dam. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2.64 billion kWh of electricity a year. The project is also expected to support flood control, irrigation, as well as water supply and fish breeding facilities. According to a \\u2018valuation report\\u2019 that was undertaken prior to implementation, the project would likely negatively impact 22,100 persons, 15,958 farmlands and 6,762 properties domiciled in 98 communities. Sinohydro and CNEEC are the contractors responsible for project implementation.   On May 28, 2013, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. Then, on January 22, 2018, the placement of the first silo of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) took place. As of June 18, 2020, the Government of Nigeria\\u2019s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that China Eximbank had disbursed 52.65% of the original face value of the PBC. By October 28, 2019, the project had achieved a 68% completion rate. The rotor of the first power generation unit was hoisted into place on September 30, 2021. Then, on March 28, 2022, the first (175MW) power generation unit went into operation. The unit was officially commissioned on April 1, 2022. However, the broader project has encountered major implementation obstacles and delays.   In 2015, the project stalled due to insufficient compensation of communities affected by the power plant (requiring resettlement) and litigation by aggrieved persons.  Nigeria\\u2019s then Minister of State for Power, Mohammed Wakil, confirmed the stoppage of the project in an interview. He said: \\u2018immediately [after] the Zungeru project took off, we had legal challenges. Somehow in the communities, some people, I can say powerful people instituted court action and in fact they succeeded in getting an injunction restraining government from further doing the project. [\\u2026] At a point we had about two to three litigations on the project but the ministry has been trying to resolve the problems outside the court. A committee has been set up and they have held several meetings with the parties involved. It is a national project and we do not want to be unnecessarily bogged down by litigations. [\\u2026] We are being careful and are engaging the parties with a view to settling out of court. That has tampered with our timetable but even with that there has been a lot of progress.\\u2019 Nigeria\\u2019s Director of Power, Sanusi Garba, said at the time that \\u2018you cannot pay 98 communities overnight. We have checks and counter checks at every point in time, and it is a slow and laborious process because you don\\u2019t want to pay someone twice and you don\\u2019t want to omit anybody.\\u2019   Then, in January 2022, three Chinese workers were abducted from the project site after a shoot-out that killed workers and police.  In March 2022, Nigeria\\u2019s Minister of Power, Abubakar D. Aliyu, said \\u2018[i]t\\u2019s unfortunate that the insecurity in some parts of the country has affected the delivery of the Zungeru Hydro Plant project because some persons were abducted by bandits and have not been released\\u2019.   The 700MW Zungeru Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project was originally scheduled for completion by the end of 2017. However, its scheduled completion date was later pushed back to December 2021 and then December 2022.\",\"On December 1, 2015, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) and Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance signed a $997.7 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. It disbursed $200 million in June 2018, $129.6 million in 2020, $33.83 million in 2021, and $171.6 million in 2022.   The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $217,121,910.95 as of 2021.    Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance used the loan proceeds to on-lend to Hwange Electricity Supply Company (HESCO), which is a special purpose vehicle (project company) that is jointly owned by Zimbabwe Power Company (64% equity stake) and Sinohydro (36% equity stake). HESCO entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) to off-take electricity from the constructed Hwange 7 & 8 Thermal Power Station. HESCO is expected to service the China Eximbank PBC with revenue derived from power sales to ZETDC.    The total cost of the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project is $2.148 billion and it is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. Standard Bank (unknown amount) and AfreximBank ($176 million) are the other sources of debt financing. 85% of the cost of HESCO\\u2019s engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro will be covered by the China Eximbank PBC. The remaining 15% ($176 million) will be provided through an equity contribution from Sinohydro. The purpose of the project is to construct Unit 7 and Unit 8 at the Hwange Makomo Power Station, and thereby increase the power generation capacity of the Hwange Makomo Power Station from 600 MW to 1200 MW (through the addition of two power generation units). Hwange Makomo Power Station is a coal-fired power plant and the 14th largest thermal station in the Southern African region. It is adjacent to the Wankie Colliery Open Cast Mine.   The station was built in two stages. The first four power generation (4x120 MW) units were commissioned between 1983 and 1986 and the fifth and sixth power generation (2x220 MW) units were commissioned in 1986 and 1987. These six units are already functional and the station currently generates about 40% percent of the country\\u2019s electricity needs. Coal is delivered to the station by an overland conveyor belt which is 6 kilometers long from Hwange Colliery Company Limited (HCCL) as well as by trucks from Makomo and Coalbrick mines. Water that is piped 44 kilometers from the Zambezi River is pumped into two 150,000-cubic-meter reservoirs next to the station and conveyed by gravity to its point of use. Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and it has hired 2532 employees (620 Chinese workers and 1912 local workers) as well as 252 sub-contractor employees (including 217 local workers). After the PBC agreement with China Eximbank was signed on December 1, 2015, the lender demanded that the Government of Zimbabwe meet several conditions, including parliamentary ratification of the PBC; the establishment of a debt service reserve agreement (DSRA) between the Government of Zimbabwe, China Eximbank and HESCO; the establishment of a PPA between HESCO and Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC); the establishment of an agreement between Government of Zimbabwe and HESCO outlining the incentives for the project (in terms of taxation) and guaranteeing ZETDC\\u2019s payments to HESCO; the signing of a coal supply agreement between HESCO and Makomo Resources, and the signing of a limestone supply agreement between HESCO and PPC (Zimbabwe). These requirements led to project implementation delays.    The first loan disbursement from China Eximbank took place in June 2018, which paved the way for project commencement on August 1, 2018. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 42 months (February 1, 2022). A formal groundbreaking ceremony was organized on June 27, 2018. Then, on March 1, 2019, a foundation stone laying ceremony took place. As of November 2019, the project had achieved a 25% completion rate. Then, in September 2020, reports emerged that the borrower had failed to comply with the terms of its escrow account agreement with China Eximbank and it instead issued a savings bond as collateral (security) in favor of the lender. By February 2021, the project was running behind schedule; it had achieved a 58.29% completion rate (against a target completion rate of 78.5%). The delay was attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and unpaid invoices (IPC payments). As of April 2022, Forbes Chanakira, a project manager for the Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion, reported that the project had achieved an 84.2% completion (progress) rate. He reported that the turbines and generator sets for Unit 7 had been constructed and were awaiting commissioning. At that time, the boiler was about 93% complete and the coal stockyard was expected to be operational in May 2022. The boiler\\u2019s control system, the Distributed Control System (DCS), had also been activated. Hot commissioning, a process in which coal is used in the boiler to heat steam, was expected at the time to begin by July 2022. It was expected to last until November 2022 when the unit would be handed off.    Forbes Chanakira also stated in April 2022 that about 810 of the 875 transmission towers built between Hwange and Bulawayo had been placed. At the time, on the 368 km section between Hwange and Bulawayo, a new 400KV line \\u2014 that would run parallel to the current lines \\u2014 still needed to be built. The route had been separated into three sections: Bulawayo to Lupane, Lupane to Gwayi, and Gwayi to Hwange, where engineers were working on building towers alongside other construction work. At one point, this project had employed 450 people, but the project ultimately is expected to employ more than 3,000 people.\",\"On May 29, 2012, Turkey's Ministry of Transport granted a 10-year concession agreement to ICA IC \\u0130\\u00e7ta\\u015f Astaldi \\u00dc\\u00e7\\u00fcnc\\u00fc Bo\\u011faz K\\u00f6pr\\u00fcs\\u00fc ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yat\\u0131r\\u0131m ve \\u0130\\u015fletme A.\\u015e. (IC Ictas-Astaldi or ICA) \\u2014 a joint venture between an Italian construction company called Astaldi S.P.A (33.33% ownership stake) and a Turkish construction company called IC \\u0130\\u00e7ta\\u015f Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. (66.66% ownership stake) \\u2014 for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtk\\u00f6y-Akyaz\\u0131 Section (\\u201cAsia Section\\u201d or \\u201cNMM Asia\\u201d) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S.\\u00a0for the 90 km K\\u0131nal\\u0131-Odayeri Section (\\u201cEurope Section\\u201d or \\u201cNMM Europe\\u201d) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project. The loan agreements were signed in September 2013 and financial close was achieved May 2014. The loan were issued by six local banks, including Turkish banks (T\\u00fcrkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., T\\u00fcrkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., T\\u00fcrkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and T\\u00fcrkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.). One loan will mature in December 2022 (with a fixed interest rate of 7.6%) and the other will mature in June 2024 (with a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 550 basis points).   Additionally, $600 million of equity financing was provided by Astaldi S.P.A and IC \\u0130\\u00e7ta\\u015f Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S.: $387.33 million IC \\u0130\\u00e7ta\\u015f Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. and $193.67 million from Astaldi S.P.A. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey\\u2019s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018. Under the agreement, ICBC Turkey agreed in principle to facilitate the refinancing of the project, previously funded by the Turkish banking system, on more favorable terms.   Then, in September 2019, two syndicated loan agreements worth $4.435 billion were signed (with ICBC serving as the lead arranger) for the Kurtk\\u00f6y-Akyaz\\u0131 and K\\u0131nal\\u0131-Odayeri sections of the project: a $2,840,000,000 loan agreement was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt T\\u00fcrk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka T\\u00fcrk Kat\\u0131l\\u0131m Bankas\\u0131 A.\\u015e., T\\u00fcrkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., T\\u00fcrkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C.

The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019. The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China\\u2019s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasak\\u00f6y route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya.

Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (\\u201cConsortium Company\\u201d) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (\\u201cIC Maintenance\\u201d), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi. Shareholders of the Consortium Company expected to invest up to $688.5 million. As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company\\u2019s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC \\u0130\\u00e7ta\\u015f Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner.\",\"On June 4, 2008, Reliance Communications Limited (RCOM) obtained a $750 million loan (Facility I) from China Development Bank (CDB) to fund its nationwide GSM rollout efforts.

China Eximbank and Sinosure representatives attended the EPC contract signing ceremony. Then, on September 5, 2016, GNPD signed a $1 billion syndicated loan agreement with China Eximbank and other Chinese lenders for the first power generation unit of the 1336 (2 x 668) MW Dinginin Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. The borrower purchased a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. On December 6, 2017, GNPD signed an additional $1.7 billion (PHP 22 billion) syndicated loan agreement with a group of Filipino banks for the second power generation unit of the 1336 (2 x 668) MW Dinginin Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 1.3GW supercritical, coal-fired power project \\u2014 with two 668 MW power generation units \\u2014 in the Bataang Peninsula of Philippines. The Dinginin coal-fired power project is located at the entrance of Manila Bay, in Dinginin, approximately 5km away from Mariveles city, in the Bataan Peninsula of Philippines. The project site covers approximately 60 hectares and lies adjacent to the CDB-financed 600MW Mariveles power plant. The Dinginin power plant consists of two supercritical, pulverised coal-fired units of 668MW capacity each. Each block is equipped with a flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) system to control emissions. The other components of the plant include high-pressure and low-pressure heaters, distributed control system (DCS), transformers, circuit breakers, gas insulated switchyard, dual optical ground wire power transmission cable, coal mills, coal handling system, auxiliary seawater cooling water pumps, and condensate water pumps. The project utilizes an 80,000t coal terminal, along with two 120m-diameter circular coal yards. The electricity generated by the Dinginin coal-fired power project will be evacuated to the grid through a double-circuit 500kV power transmission line.   Shanghai Electric Power Construction Co. Ltd. is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, many other contractors are involved in the project. China Electric Power Construction Company served as the construction contractor.

As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company\\u2019s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC \\u0130\\u00e7ta\\u015f Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner.\",\"On May 11, 2018, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq signed an export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement (contract ID# FA-IRAQ-001). Under the terms of the 20-year agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is authorized to borrow up to $10 billion (or an equivalent amount in other currencies such as RMB) via subsidiary buyer\\u2019s credit facility agreements with PRC banks and/or commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier\\u2019s credits) with Chinese companies (exporters) for projects in the \\u2018oil, gas, energy, infrastructure, communications, education, healthcare or electricity sectors\\u2019 that are \\u2018located in the areas in Iraq deemed safe by the Embassy of China and the Government of Iraq.\\u2019 All borrowings under the framework agreement, which is captured via Project ID#95982, must carry maturity lengths that do not exceed 15 years and they must be backed by an approved credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The framework agreement also specifies that the Government of Iraq is responsible for making advance payments worth no less than 15% of the total cost of the underlying commercial contracts supported by the subsidiary buyer\\u2019s credits and supplier\\u2019s credits.   To repay and secure these borrowings, the framework agreement specifies that a Crude Oil Sales Agreement between Iraq's state-owned oil marketing company (SOMO or \\u0634\\u0631\\u0643\\u0629 \\u062a\\u0633\\u0648\\u064a\\u0642 \\u0627\\u0644\\u0646\\u0641\\u0637) and an unspecified Chinese oil importer, wherein SOMO agrees to sell no fewer than 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the Chinese oil importer and the Chinese oil importer agrees to make payments to SOMO due under the Crude Oil Sales Agreement by depositing U.S. dollars (or another foreign currency) in a Sinosure-designated and lender-controlled bank (escrow) account (that is opened on behalf of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq to facilitate debt repayment).  Under the terms of the framework agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is required to maintain a minimum cash balance of $100 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and pledge the DSRA in favor of Sinosure. Apart from the DSRA, the framework agreement refers to two additional escrow accounts: an Oil Settlement Account and a Repayment Account. All oil sale proceeds first flow to the Oil Settlement Account. Then, after deductions are made by the United Nations Compensation Commission for compensation due to Kuwait, the remaining revenue flows to the Repayment Account (so long as there is still a $100 million minimum cash balance in the DSRA) and principal and interest payments to lenders are made from the Repayment Account.   On September 23, 2019, account agreement and oil agreement annexes to the framework agreement were finalized. Then, on September 23, 2019, the framework agreement officially went into effect. Approximately 15 months later, in December 2020, a Financial Advisor to Iraq\\u2019s Prime Minister, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih, told the Iraqi News Agency (INA), that Iraq\\u2019s House of Representatives would need to identify the specific projects to be funded under the framework agreement and allocate funds for these projects in the Federal Budget Law. He also signaled at the time that the Iraqi Government planned to borrow through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure to fund the construction of school buildings. Then, in June 2021, he announced that the 2021 Federal Budget Law included $2 billion for projects to be financed through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure, which had entered into force. 5 months later, in November 2021, he told a local newspaper that several Chinese companies had deposited $1.8 billion in an account and the funds would be used to support the construction of 1,000 schools as well as \\u2018infrastructure and renewable power projects\\u2019. This announcement implies that the Government of Iraq ultimately decided to borrowed via commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier\\u2019s credits) with Chinese companies rather than buyer\\u2019s credit facilities with PRC banks. On June 30, 2022, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih said that \\u2018[t]he operations of depositing money and withdrawing from the [escrow] account are continuing for the benefit of the projects concluded within the [export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure].\\u2019 He also noted that \\u2018the [escrow] account is managed very carefully by the Central Bank of Iraq, and the financial operations are audited by the major international financial auditing companies.\\u2019  There are three known projects \\u2014 supported by four separate commercial contracts \\u2014 that are being financed under the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure: the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project, the Construction of 1000 Schools Project, and the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project. In September 2013, China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and Ministry of Electricity of Iraq signed a $1,189,132,251 commercial (EPC) contract for the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project. This contract was amended on November 21, 2019 and its monetary value was increase by $140 million (to ~$1,329,132,251) after CMEC and the Government of Iraq signed a financing memorandum on September 22, 2019. The estimated monetary value of the supplier\\u2019s credit for the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project is $1,129,762,413.35 (as captured via Project ID#95996).   The purpose of the project is to construct an oil-fired thermal power plant that consists of two subcritical, oil-fired generating units of 630MW capacity each (\\u2018Unit 1\\u2019 and \\u2018Unit 2\\u2019). Upon completion, each unit is expected consist of a boiler drum along with a boiler furnace equipped with oil and gas nozzles, and a single shaft steam turbine. The boiler assembly will feature four-corner tangential combustion chamber, along with single-hearth balanced ventilation supported by steel structure frame. The design boiler maximum continuous rating (BMCR) will be 2136t/h. Each double back pressure, impulse type steam turbine will feature three cylinders and four exhausts. The other major components of the plant will include three-stage high pressure heaters, four- stage low pressure heaters, eight-stage regenerative deaerators, apart from steam-driven feedwater pumps. The project also includes four 20,000m3 oil mixing tanks, air compressors, as well as the construction of 400kV and 132kV booster stations. The electricity generated by the power project will be evacuated through a 400kV power transmission line connecting the national grid of Iraq. The power plant is located approximately 16 km southeast of the Samara city in Salah Al-din Province on the north bank of the Tigris River (and approximately 186 km north of Baghdad).   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Northwest Research Institute of Energy China, SGS, the Fourth Construction of China Machinery Industry Co., Ltd., China Valves Technology, Inc. and Sichuan Railway Investment Group Co., Ltd. are also involved in implementation as subcontractors.  Project implementation officially commenced on August 14, 2012. However, civil construction works did not begin until April 2013. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 45 months (January 2017). Construction works were suspended in June 2014 due to the fact that Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) launched a major attack in northern Iraq against the Iraqi government, which led to a major deterioration in the local security situation. Construction works resumed in mid-2018. As of August 2019, 1200 Chinese and Iraqi workers were assigned to the project. Then, on November 21, 2019, the Ministry of Electricity of Iraq (MOELC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) signed an expanded and amended EPC contract, which allocated $140 million of additional funding for additional repair and inspection work and the construction of a new 132kV substation. On April 1, 2020, Zhang Tao, the Chinese Ambassador to Iraq, and a team from the Red Cross Society of China visited the power plant and provided on-site Covid-19 pandemic prevention and control guidance. Fifteen days later. On April 16, 2020, the boiler hydraulic test for Unit 1 took place, marking an important milestone of the project. Unit 1 began trial operations on June 2, 2021. However in late-June 2021, ISIS launched a set of targeted by Katyusha rockets at the Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant and severely damaged parts of Unit 1.  The Unit 1 boiler was ignited on May 11 , 2022, and it was connected to the grid on May 12, 2022. Unit 1 then began a 720-hour reliability test on May 20, 2022. On June 19, 2022, Unit 1 passed the 720-hour reliability test. CMEC then handed over Unit 1 to the project owner in July 2022, which marked halfway point of the implementation of the project. On August 27, 2022, Unit 2 was connected to the national grid for the first time and officially put into operation. \",\"On October 28, 2009, Nam Ngum 3 Power Company Limited \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between Ratchaburi Holding (25% ownership stake), GMS Lao Company Limited (27% ownership stake), Marubeni Corporation (25% ownership stake), and Lao Holding State Enterprise (23% ownership stake) \\u2014 was establish to develop and implement the 480MW Nam Ngum 3 Hydropower Project (or \\u201cNG3\\u201d) as an independent power project (IPP).   Then, Nam Ngum 3 Power Company Limited entered into a tariff MOU with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) on the 480MW Nam Ngum 3 Hydropower Project. Then, in 2013/2014, \\u00c9lectricit\\u00e9 du Laos (EDL) \\u2014 the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets \\u2014 acquired full ownership of the NG3 from Nam Ngum 3 Power Company Limited.   On July 28, 2014, in Beijing, China Eximbank and EDL signed a buyer\\u2019s credit financing framework agreement for the NG3 Project. According to the framework agreement, China Eximbank agreed to provide a $1.2 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) to EDL to facilitate its acquisition of equipment from Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and support its implementation of the NG3 Project. Official sources confirm that a $1.2 billion BCL agreement (transliterated \\u201ccommercial loan\\u201d from China) from China Eximbank was subsequently issued to EDL. However, the precise signing date of the agreement is unknown. The borrowing terms of the BCL are unknown. The proceeds of the BCL were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $1.29 billion commercial (EPC) contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd.   The purpose of the NG3 project was to construct a 210 meter-high concrete face rockfill dam (CFRD) with a total capacity of 480 MW (3x160 MW) on the Ngum River in Xaysomboune Province, about 130 km north of Vientiane. The project is located in the upstream of Nam Ngum 1 (NN1) and Nam Ngum 2 (NN2), and in the downstream of Nam Ngum 4(NN4) and Nam Ngum 5 (NN5).   Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. is the EPC responsible for implementation. Construction officially began on November 11, 2015. However, the project subsequently experienced significant implementation delays. Also of August 2022, the project had achieved a 79.8% completion. The project's originally expected completion date was in 2022.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 480MW Nam Ngum 3 Hydropower Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2017, the World Bank was informed that EDL would sell a 80 percent equity stake in Nam Ngum 3 Power Project (\\u201cNG3\\u201d) to a Lao private company called Chaleun Sekong Group Company Limited (CSG). EDL and CSE, an affiliate company of CSG, then entered into an Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of the Share Capital of Nam Ngum 3 Power Company Limited on July, 26, 2019, which included the right of EGAT International Company Limited (EGATi) to purchase the shares of Nam Ngum 3 Power Company Limited under the Share Purchase Agreement upon approval from Thai Government. EGATI is the international investment arm of Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). EDL reportedly divested its ownership in NG3 and NG4 (captured in Project ID#63452) in order to reduce its indebtedness.  These divestments were expected to provide substantial financial relief to EDL as its NG3 and NG4  project debts amounted over $1 billion by 2017. However, as of 2017, the project debt for NG3\\u2014mostly from China Eximbank\\u2014was still pending a transfer from EDL to the project company (Nam Ngum 3 Power Company Limited).\",\"On December 2, 2006, a joint venture between NORINCO and Kayson Inc. signed a $791 million commercial contract for the Ahvaz Light Rail Line 1 Project. Under the terms of the contract, NORINCO was responsible for the project\\u2019s mechanical and electrical engineering requirements (costing $449 million), and Kayson Inc. was responsible for the project\\u2019s civil engineering requirements (costing $342 million).   According to China\\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), the Chinese Government agreed to finance 85% of the cost of the commercial contract with a $672.35 million buyer\\u2019s credit loan. The lending institution is not known. Nor are the borrowing terms of the loan.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 23 km light rail in the city of Ahvaz (with 24 stops) between Pasdaran blvd. and Golestan blvd.   The duration of the commercial contract was 48 months, and the originally expected project completion date was December 2, 2010. However, as of July 5, 2020, the project had still only achieved a physical completion rate of 30%. Ahvaz Mayor, Musa Shaeri, also announced the cancellation of the contract with Kayson Inc. due to suspicions that it had not allocated funds where they needed to go. Construction was halted, pending the identification of a new contractor.\",\"On May 24, 2018, China Eximbank and PT Huadian Bukit Asam Power (HBAP) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between PT Bukit Asam Tbk (45% ownership stake) and China Huadian Hong Kong Company Ltd (55% ownership stake) \\u2014 signed a $1.26 billion loan agreement for the 1240MW Bangko Tengah (SS-8) Mine Mouth Power Plant Construction Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR + a 2.85% margin. The $1.59 billion project is being implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) and financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. The transaction also appears to be backed by a Sinosure credit insurance and/or investment insurance policy.  The purpose of the project is to construct a 1,240 megawatt (MW) coal-fired power station \\u2014 with two 620MW generators (Unit 1 and Unit 2) \\u2014 near the Tanjung Enim coal mine in South Sumatra Province (exact locational coordinates: -3.838679, 103.804133). The project site is located 2 km away from the Central Banko coal mine in Muara Enim, South Sumatra, Indonesia. The power plant\\u2019s coal-fired power generation units will be equipped with a super-critical boiler along with a high-efficiency steam turbine and a generator. The plant will also be fitted with a flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) system to control emissions.The Sumsel-8 power plant will consume up to 5.4 million tonnes (Mt) of coal a year, which will be sourced through a 1.5km-long enclosed conveyor belt from the Banko Tengah coal mine operated by PTBA in the Tanjung Enim area. The project also involves the construction of a 45 km transmission line from the power plant to the PLN substation in Muara Enim.  On November 7, 2015, South Sumatra Governor Alex Noerdin attended a groundbreaking ceremony at the project site. Then, on October 19, 2017, HBAP signed a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN), which is an Indonesian government-owned corporation that has a monopoly on electricity distribution in Indonesia and generates the majority of the country's electrical power. China Huadian Hongkong Company Ltd. is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Inter World Steel Mills Indonesia and Mutiara Indah Anugrah are also involved as subcontractors. Inter World Steel Mills Indonesia has provided thesteel solutions for the Sumsel-8 coal-fired power project, while the key equipment including boilers, turbines and generators were supplied by contractors based in China. Mutiara Indah Anugrah, a construction company based in Indonesia, was contracted to perform construction and installation works for the project in 2019. Construction commenced in June 2018. By the end of 2019, the project had achieved a 22% completion rate. In March 2020, the project's sponsor declared force majeure and stated that project would be delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unit 1 was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) in December 2021, while Unit 2 was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) in March 2022. As of November 2021, the project was 92.84% complete.\",\"On May 9, 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Government of Angola signed a USD 1.2891 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the New Angola International Airport (NAIA) Construction Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, an 18-month grace period, and an unknown interest rate. It is backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower is expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of a USD 1.51 billion commercial contract between Angola\\u2019s Ministry of Transportation (MINTRANS) and China National Aero-Technology International Engineering Corporation (AVIC-ENG).   The purpose of the project is to construct and equip the New Angola International Airport (NAIA), which is located approximately 40 km to the southeast of the centre of Luanda, in the Bom Jesus commune, Icole e Bengo municipality in Luanda Province. The airport is designed to be an alternative to the existing Quatro de Fevereiro Airport, another international airport that serves Luanda. The new airport is being designed to have an annual capacity of 15 million passengers and 600,000 tons of cargo, with a 4,200 meter runway and 3,800 meter runway, and a 160,000 square meter terminal. The airport will also have 12 aircraft docks, a VIP passenger terminal, and an air traffic control tower.   China National Aero-Technology International Engineering Corporation (AVIC-ENG) is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Construction on this project began in 2007 under the management of the China International Fund (CIF); however, in February 2019, the Angolan Government announced that it had cancelled the contract with CIF. CIF was replaced by AVIC-Eng. Other contractors and suppliers involved in the project are Metallurgical Corporation of China (CTMCC), Dalian Zongyi Science & Technology Development, Fangda New Materials (Jiangxi), and Beijing Urban Construction Exploration & Surveying Design Research Institute. Angola's Ministry of Transportation (MoT) also appointed Mace Engineering Group as project manager and site supervisor for the project on March 27, 2015.   As of August 2019, the project had achieved a 60% completion rate, with plans to commission the airport in 2022. However, due to financial problems, work on the project was halted in 2019. Then, at the second Ordinary Session of the Cabinet Council, held on February 28, 2019, Angola\\u2019s Ministry of Transport was directed to conduct technical and financial review of the project in order to guarantee its completion, ensure better alignment with various ministerial departments, and establish a new schedule of actions. Then, in May, 2020, an addendum to the commercial contract between AVIC-Eng and MINTRANS was signed. At the same time, the parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) as part of the technical review work to adapt the quality and operational parameters of the new airport.   Work resumed on May 17, 2021. Then, on June 17, 2022, the airport organized its first test flight as part of a certification process and it was officially renamed Agostinho Neto International Airport. The project is now scheduled for completion on December 31, 2023. In 2017, China Development Bank reportedly also issued a loan for the New Luanda International Airport Construction Project (see Project ID#72349) but it was apparently replaced by the ICBC loan that is captured via Project ID#65402. In 2018, Bank of China (BOC) provided a $148,721,360 buyer's credit loan (BCL) for the Luanda New International Airport Railway Branch Line Project (see Project ID#65524). \",\"On December 5, 2016, the Government of Angola entered into a $4.1 billion syndicated loan facility agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Eximbank, China Construction Bank, Bank of China, China Minsheng Bank, and Ping An Bank for the 2,171MW Caculo Caba\\u00e7a Dam and Transmission Line Project. Project ID#67108 captures ICBC\\u2019s $1.239 billion contribution  to the loan syndicate. Project ID#67109 captures China Eximbank\\u2019s $909 million contribution to the loan syndicate. Project ID#67110 captures Bank of China\\u2019s $619.8 million contribution to the loan syndicate. Project ID#67111 captures China Construction Bank\\u2019s $619.8 million contribution to the loan syndicate. The remaining contributions to the syndicated loan came from China Minsheng Bank ($371.88 million) and Ping An Bank ($371.88 million), both of which are privately-owned Chinese banks.    The loan carries a term (maturity) of up to 15 years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.6% margin. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The proceeds of this loan were to be used by the borrower to finance up to 85% of the cost of a $4,532,114,041.00 commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with CGGC-Niara \\u2014 a joint venture of China Gezhouba Group Corporation (60% stake), Boreal Investments Limited (37.5% stake), and NIARA Holding (2.5% stake) \\u2014 signed on June 11, 2015. As of December 31, 2021, the $4.1 billion syndicated loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate.   The project involves the construction of 2171 MW Caculo Caba\\u00e7a Hydroelectric Power Station, which is located at the village of S\\u00e3o Pedro da Quilemba, near the city of Dondo, in Cuanza Norte Province. This location is approximately 195 kilometers (121 mi), by road, southeast of Luanda, the capital and largest city of Angola. The project has three main components: temporary river diversion works, main construction works, and the supply of electromechanical equipment. The main dam will be 103 meters (338 ft) in height, with crest width of 553 meters (1,814 ft), creating a reservoir lake that measures 16.3 kilometers (10 mi) in length, with a surface area of 16.6 square kilometers (6 sq mi).  Upon completion, the power plant is projected to generate an average of 8,566 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7.2 million tons annually.  An official inauguration ceremony marking the beginning of construction was held on August 4, 2017. Construction was originally expected to last 80 months, so project completion was scheduled for April 2024. However, the project subsequently encountered various delays and problems. In September 2017, a corruption investigation by Der Spiegel, the Portuguese newspaper Expresso, and European Investigative Collaborations, an independent journalism centre, revealed that the daughter of President Jos\\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, billionaire businesswoman Isabel dos Santos, is the beneficial owner of Boreal Investments Limited (a shell company that was registered in Hong Kong in 2012). Then, on November 5, 2019, the President of Angola formally authorized Presidential Order No. 79/18 (from July 12, 2019) which amended the EPC contract for the 171 MW Caculo Caba\\u00e7a Dam and Transmission Line Project by removing CGGC-Niara and Boreal Investments Limited so that \\u2018the only party to the contract is China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC)\\u2019. Then, in May 2022, there was a major labor disturbance at the project site. Protestors ransacked the management offices at the project site and the police shot three workers. The workers were reportedly angry over low wages and poor treatment by their employer (CGGC).  As of June 2020, 90% of tunneling work necessary to divert the Cuanza River to the dam had been completed and 3.47% of work on the dam itself had been completed. Then, on May 20, 2023, a ceremony was held to mark the temporary diversion of the Cuanza River, which marked the beginning of the main construction phase of the hydroelectric power project.  At that time, the project employed more than 2,500 workers, of whom more than 81 percent were local, and the connection of the first generator to the power grid was scheduled for completion by 2026.\",\"On July 27, 2021, SBM Offshore announced that it had signed contracts with Petr\\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) for the 26.25 years lease and operation of FPSO Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9 vessel. These contracts follow the signing of a binding letter of intent on February 25, 2021. The FPSO Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9 vessel will be deployed to the B\\u00fazios oilfield, in which China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) and China National Oil & Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) are participants. The B\\u00fazios oilfield is located in Santos Basin, southeast offshore of Brazil, with an average water depth of approximately 2,200 meters. It is the world's largest deep-water pre-salt producing oil field.   n August 20, 2021, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $1.5 billion receivables financing agreement with FPSO Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9 (B\\u00fazios 6) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of SBM Offshore \\u2014 for the Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9 Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) Unit Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. Then, on September 23, 2021, FPSO Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9 (B\\u00fazios 6) signed a $635 million bridge loan (facility) agreement for the financing of the construction of FPSO Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9. The tenor of the bridge loan was twelve months with an extension option for another six months. Repayment was expected to take place upon closure and the first drawdown of the \\u2018project loan\\u2019.  Then, on January 25, 2022, SBM Offshore announced that it had entered into a shareholder agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK). MC and NYK acquired 25% and 20% ownership stakes, respectively, in FPSO Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9 (B\\u00fazios 6), leaving SBM Offshore with a 55% ownership stake.  Delivery of the FPSO Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9 was originally expected to take place in the second half of 2024.  The FPSO is being built under SBM Offshore's Fast4Ward program. The Fast4Ward program includes a new build, multi-Purpose Floater hull combined with several standardized topsides modules. SBM Offshore\\u2019s fourth Fast4Ward MPF hull has been allocated to this project. Under the Fast4Ward program, SBM Offshore usually orders an FPSO hull without a firm contract in hand, so that, when a contract is secured, the FPSO delivery time is shorter. The hull that has been allocated for the FPSO Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9 was ordered in China in December 2019. Once delivered, the FPSO Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9 will have a water injection capacity of 250,000 barrels per day and a minimum storage capacity of 1.4 million barrels of crude oil. As of May 2022, SBM Offshore reported that topsides fabrication for FPSO Almirante Tamandar\\u00e9 and construction of the Fast4Ward Multi-Purpose Floater (MPF) hull were progressing in China and Brazil.\",\"On March 9, 2011, Reliance Communications entered into a $1.33 billion term loan facility agreement (\\\"Facility III\\\") with China Development Bank (CDB) to refinance a 3G spectrum fee payment and facilitate the acquisition of equipment imports from unspecified Chinese vendors. This loan carried an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.25% margin, but its maturity and grace period are unknown. It was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) (1) a first pari passu charge over the present and future moveable plant and machinery and capital work in progress of, and all rights, title, interest, benefits, claims and demands under and in respect of all insurance contracts entered into in relation to these assets by Reliance Communications Limited, Reliance Communications Infrastructure Limited, Reliance Infratel Limited and Reliance Telecom Limited; (2) assignment of 20 unified access service licenses, a national long-distance license and an international long-distance license of Reliance Communications Limited; and (3) pledge of: (i) 66,980,095 equity shares of Reliance Telecom Limited held by Reliance Communications Limited; (ii) 18,019,900 equity shares of Reliance Telecom Limited held by Reliance Infocomm Infrastructure Limited; and (iii) 9,379,999,994 equity shares of Reliance Communications Infrastructure Limited held by Reliance Communications Limited.  As of December 31, 2014, the (principal) amount outstanding under this facility was $1.237 billion. In February 2019, Reliance Communications filed for bankruptcy as it was unable to sell assets to repay its debts. \",\"In 2009, a syndicated of Chinese state-owned banks (including China Eximbank) signed a $1.112 billion syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement with the National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) \\u2014 a state-owned Iranian company \\u2014 for the purchase of 12 very large crude carriers (VLCCs) weighing 318,000 tons each from China. The main source of funding was the Export-Import Bank of China, but other banks also participated. The names of these banks and loan terms were not disclosed.  The combined capacity of all the VLCCs was 24 million barrels of crude oil. China Eximbank was reportedly the largest contributor to the syndicated loan. The total cost of each VLCC was approximately $102 million, i.e. $1.2 billion USD, and the syndicate of banks agreed to finance 90% of the total project cost. The order was split evenly between Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Co. Ltd (a subsidiary of CSSC) and the Dalian Shipbuilding Industry Co. Ltd (a subsidiary of CSIC). The order for the ships was first placed in 2009.   The first ship, christened 'Safe', was expected to be delivered by May 2012. Another 7 ships were to be delivered by the end of 2012 with the remaining 4 ships to be delivered by the end of 2013. There is some evidence that this project entered implementation. A 2012 Reuters article notes that NITC paid 2/3 of the $600 million order to one of the Chinese shipyards. However, precise VLCC delivery dates are unavailable.\",\"On July 25, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Iran\\u2019s Bank of Industry and Mine \\u2014 an Iranian state-owned bank\\u2014 signed a RMB 10,079,127,539,730 ($1.5 billion) loan agreement for the Tehran-Mashhad High-Speed Electrification Upgrading Project. The loan carried a 16-year maturity and a 6-year grace period. Its interest rate is unknown. However, it is known that the borrower expected to make payments for interest, fees, and insurance worth RMB 4,337,000,000 \\u2014 in nominal terms \\u2014 over the lifetime of the loan. It is also known that the proceeds of the loan were used to finance approximately 85% of the cost of an RMB 11.5 billion commercial contract ($1.67 billion) with China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC), which was signed in June 2015. A sovereign guarantee was issued by Iran\\u2019s Ministry of Economy in support of the loan.   The purpose of the project was to electrify a 926 km railway that runs from Tehran to the eastern city of Mashhad in Khorasan Razavi Province (after passing through the cities of Garmsar, Semnan, Damghan, Shahroud, and Neishabour). Project implementation was originally expected to take 48 months. Upon completion, the project was expected to increase speed of the line from the current 160 km per hour to 200 km per hour, reduce pollution and increase the railroad\\u2019s transportation capacity. The route is already double-tracked and both tracks will be electrified through the project. According to CEO of Islamic Republic of Iran Railways Saeed Mohammadzadeh, the railroad will have the capacity to transport 25 million passengers and 10 million tons of cargo per year as soon as it is electrified.   CMC is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Mapna (an Iranian infrastructure engineering group) and Sudian Group also seem to be involved in project implementation (most likely as contractors). A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 6, 2016. However, as of June 2019, the project had only achieved a 3% completion rate. Then, in January 2021, there were reports that CMC had withdrawn from the project. It is not yet clear if this means that the China Eximbank loan was suspended or canceled. \",\"On June 28, 2012, China Eximbank and the Government of Ukraine\\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Food signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding a $3 billion line of credit (captured in Project ID#42559). This agreement, which is popularly known as the loan-for-corn deal (or loan-for-grain deal), specified that China Eximbank would provide a $3 billion line of credit to PJSC 'State Food Grain Corporation of Ukraine' (SFGCU or PJSC DPZKU) \\u2014 a Ukrainian state-owned enterprise \\u2014 in two loan tranches: the first $1.5 billion tranche would be for the purchase of grain (through forward and spot contracts) and the export of grain to China, and the second $1.5 billion tranche would be for the acquisition of Chinese goods (plant protection products, machinery, elevator equipment) and potentially also the construction of biodiesel and corn processing production plants.   Then, on October 24, 2012, SFGCU and China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CCEC) signed a 'General Contract for Cooperation.' The contract specified that the $3 billion China Eximbank loan was to be repaid within 15 years with the proceeds from grain supply contracts between SFGCU and CCEC. Grain supply was to begin in 2012 (or 2013) and continue until 2027 (or 2028). The supply/sale of maize and other grains from SFGCU to CCEC was not to be less than 80 million metric ton over the 15-year period. SFGCU agreed to supply/sell 4 million tons in the first year, 4.5 million tons in the second year, and 5.2 million tons in the third year. Grain prices were tethered to futures contracts for the relevant period of time on the Dalian Commodity Exchange of China. The contract also stipulated that, in the event that SFGCU did not meet its annual grain supply commitments, CCEC had the right to notify China Eximbank so that it could in turn adjust loan disbursements in proportion to the annual supply of grain. SFGCU also granted CCEC the right to re-export grain to other countries for their legal resale. Additionally, under the terms of the contract, SFGCU agreed to buy various goods (including fuel, mineral fertilizers, plant protection products, seeds, agricultural machinery) and services from CCEC.  The contract further stipulated that CCEC would be the main EPC contractor for any turnkey project financed by the $3 billion loan agreement. The contract identified $1.5 billion worth of goods, services, and turnkey projects that CCEC would supply to SFGCU between 2013 and 2017: $275 million for the purchase of Chinese plant protection products; $305 million for the purchase of mineral fertilizers; $55 million for the purchase of agricultural machinery; $350 million for the purchase of seeds; $70 million for the construction of a plant for organic and mineral fertilizers; $70 million for the construction of a plant for the production of plant protection products; $195 million for the construction of an agricultural market center; $15 million for agricultural waste as alternative energy sources (pellets); and $165 million for the construction of a port elevator.  Then, on December 26, 2012, China Eximbank and SFGCU signed a $1.5 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement [\\u2116 BLA 201209], which represented the first tranche described in the June 28, 2012 MOU. This loan agreement is captured in Project ID#67803. It carried the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.515% in December 2012) plus a 4.5% margin, a maturity of 15 years, and a 5 year grace period. The final maturity date of the loan was December 28, 2027. The Government of Ukraine issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. In the event that SFGCU did not meet its repayment obligations, the guarantor (the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Ukraine) agreed to pay the amount of debt that was outstanding within 20 working days of receiving a written request from China Eximbank.   The full amount of the first tranche ($1.5 billion) was reportedly disbursed by China Eximbank and deposited in an account controlled by Ukraine Export-Import Bank (Ukreximbank) on February 6, 2013. The proceeds of the loan were reportedly used by the borrower (SFGCU) for forward grain purchases (i.e the purchase of barley, wheat, and corn from Ukrainian farmers intended for export to China). However, the SFGCU did not honor its commitment to sell 4-6 million tons of grain to CCEC each year. The SFGCU\\u2019s First Deputy Board Chairman Robert Brovdi said that his company had only exported 1.5 million tons of grain to China as of December 3, 2013. Other sources suggest that grain deliveries ranged between 10% and 23% of the agreed volumes. In March 2013, CCEC filed a complaint against SFGCU at the London Court of International Arbitration for failing to fulfill its grain supply obligations (and thus effectively defaulting on its repayment obligations under its $1.5 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan with China Eximbank). Shortly thereafter, the Ukrainian media reported that the loan had been defrauded, and Ukrainian officials had demanded large bribes in return for declaring to purchase agricultural machines in China.   On March 11, 2014, the Ukrainian Ministry of Agricultural Policy and Food relieved Ihor Yakubovych, the Chairman of the SFGCU, of his duties. Then, in April 2014, CCEC and SFGCU performed a comprehensive audit of SFGCU\\u2019s implementation of projects associated with the $1.5 billion dollar loan. Then, in early September 2014, the Prosecutor General's Office informed Ihor Yakubovych that he and his deputy were suspected of a crime: misuse of credit funds (from China Eximbank) and deliberately creating the conditions for embezzlement of $15 million in cooperation with other persons. Several months later, in January 2015, the Prosecutor General's Office put Ihor Yakubovych and his deputy on a \\u2018wanted list\\u2019 for allegedly fabricating official documents and embezzling funds. According to an investigation undertaken by the Prosecutor General's Office, Ihor Yakubovych and the SFGCU Director of the Department of Trading and Sales purchased grain for loans obtained under state guarantees through fictitious enterprises and sold the grain below market price to such companies as SN, Trans Trade RK SA, RL Prosperis Commerce SA, Trans Trade RK SA, Apiq Commodities Gmbh, Ai Amal General Traiding Limited, QAM7, and GSteam. In 2015, China Eximbank and SFGCU amended the $1.5 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement in an unusual way. The amended agreement specified (in Annex 3) that, for every ton of grain exported by SFGCU to China, SFGCU would be obliged to pay China Eximbank a $5 \\u2018commission\\u2019 (above and beyond its principal and interest repayment obligations). Additional problems arose in 2017. On March 20, 2017, SFGCU was accused of attempting to illegally appropriate a privately-owned grain port terminal to increase its export capacity to China. Several media outlets also reported in 2017 that Ukreximbank froze SFGCU\\u2019s bank accounts at the request of China Eximbank.   Due to anticipated loan repayment difficulties, SFGCU and China Eximbank also engaged in debt rescheduling negotiations in March 2017. The parties ultimately agreed to reduce the loan\\u2019s interest rate from 6-month LIBOR + a 4.5% margin to 6-month LIBOR + a 3% margin. This loan rescheduling is captured via Project ID#85202.  Semi-annual principal repayments  commenced in January 2018 and the loan's principal amount outstanding stood at $1.2 billion in October 2019 and $900 million in October 2021.   Additional problems and controversies arose in 2019 and 2020. At the end of 2019, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) reported the detention of another former SFGCU chairman in Lithuania. Then, in early 2020, the Acting Chairman of the Board of SFGCU, Simon Chernyavsky, announced that law enforcement had opened 150 criminal cases against SFGCU officials. He also announced on March 2, 2020 that SFGCU was ordered by the London Court of International Arbitration to pay $4 million to CCEC. In August 2021, Ihor Yakubovych made an unsuccessful attempt to flee the country, but was detained by the National Police. In July 2022, China Eximbank was reportedly \\u2018playing hardball and threatening to send a default note on the loan\\u2019. This disclosure came at a time when the Government of Ukraine was seeking a 2-year moratorium on debt repayments to private and official creditors.  On January 23, 2020, SFGCU paid off $115.9 million on the loan issued by the Export-Import Bank of China: the corporation repaid $75 million of principal and $40.9 million of interest.\",\"On July 14, 2010, China Development Bank (CDB), Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), and Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) signed a loan agreement for Phase 2 of the Myingyan No. 1 Steel Mill Construction Project. The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 4.5% interest rate. Then, on June 14, 2011, China Development Bank, Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), and Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) signed a loan agreement for Phase 2A and 3 of the Myingyan No. 1 Steel Mill Construction Project. The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: a 21 year maturity, a 6 year grace period, and a 5% interest rate.   The precise face values of the 2010 and 2011 loans are unknown. However, according to a Government of Myanmar General Statistical Report and a Mandalay Regional Auditor General's Report (covering the period April 2018 to September 2018), total CDB disbursements for the project amounted to EUR 1,042,340,000 (EUR 566.97 million euros when the steel mill was under MEC ownership and EUR 475.37 million during the period when Myanmar\\u2019s Ministry of Industry was responsible for the steel mill).   The CDB loan repayment period for Phase 2 of the project runs from FY2015-16 to 2030-31. The CDB loan repayment period for Phase 2A and Phase 3 of the project is FY2017-18 to 2032-33. The total principal and interest outstanding under the two CDB loans was EUR 1.615 billion as of 2020.  The purpose of the project was to construct a steel mill \\u2014 with the capacity to produce 400,000 tons per year of steel, steel products, construction materials, and machinery materials \\u2014 near Sar Khar Village within Myingyan Township and the Mandalay Region (approximately 3.3 miles west of milepost 450/0 on the Yangon Myingyan Highway).   The project was implemented in three phases. Phase 1 commenced operations in March 2010 and it reportedly reached completion. However, it does not appear that Phase 2 or 3 (which were designed to produce value added products) ever reached completion. Responsibility for the steel mill was transferred from MEC to Myanmar\\u2019s Minstry of Industry on October 1, 2012.   There are some indications that the CDB loans for Myingyan No. 1 Steel Mill Construction Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. The mill was shuttered on February 17, 2017 because it was consistently losing money. Then, in 2020, the Acting Mandalay Chief Minister stated that the total project debt including interest exceeded EUR 1.615 billion. Consequently, the Government of Myanmar found itself in the position of having to pay 500 million kyats ($345,000) a day to CDB to service a loan contracted by a military-backed conglomerate (MEC) for a steel mill that was no longer operational. In 2020, CDB and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 5 loan agreements (as captured via Project ID#98030).  Debt service payments under these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#98031).  On August 16, 2021, the military junta-appointed Minister of Industry, Dr. Charlie Than, visited the project site and announced that work at the steel mill would commence 'as soon as possible' (at the instruction of coup leader Min Aung Hlaing). A Yangon-based observer monitoring investment projects in the country noted at the time that the military regime was rapidly resuming Chinese-financed projects -- paused by the [National League for Democracy (NLD) government] -- to prove that it could make the initiatives profitable: 'They are doing that intentionally and for political purposes. They want to say that they are able to do it even though the previous civilian government suspended it,' the observer said. \",\"In October 2010, the Chinese Government and the Government of Iran signed an initial agreement on the 410 km Tehran-Qom-Isfahan High-Speed Rail Project. However, due to the Iranian Government\\u2019s nuclear activities, the development of the project stalled. Then, on July 14, 2015, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) \\u2014 commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal \\u2014 was signed.   Two years later, in July 2017, China Eximbank agreed \\u2014 at least in principle \\u2014 to issue a loan to China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) through an Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Financing (EPCF) arrangement for the 245 km Qom-Isfahan Section of the 410 km Tehran-Qom-Isfahan High-Speed Rail Project. In June 2019, Noorollah Beyranvand, the Deputy Head of the Islamic Republic of Iran Railways (RAI), announced that China Eximbank had authorized the use of an RMB 13.6 billion ($1.94 million) loan for the 245 km Qom-Isfahan Section of the 410 km Tehran-Qom-Isfahan High-Speed Rail Project. The loan\\u2019s final maturity date was identified as August 2029 (implied maturity length: 10 years). The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower expects to make principal and interest repayments worth RMB 22.881 billion ($3.2 billion) \\u2014 in nominal terms \\u2014 over the lifetime of the loan. It is also known that the borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an RMB 15.3 billion ($2.3 billion) commercial contract with China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), which was signed in February 2015. As of July 2022, the loan had achieved an estimated disbursement rate of 29.4% (RMB 4 billion out of RMB 13.6 billion).   The purpose of the project is construct a 245 km section of the 410 km Tehran-Qom-Isfahan High-Speed Railway that runs from Qom to Esfahan (Isfahan). Upon completion, the railway is expected to travel 250-350 km per hour and reduce the travel time from Tehran to Isfahan to 2 hours and transport 16 million passengers per year. ICREC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Other companies that are involved in the project include Khatam Al-Anbia Construction, which is owned by Iran\\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, Siemens, and Italferr (the consulting arm the Italian national rail operator Ferrovie dello Stato). Construction began on or around April 15, 2015. 17 months later, on September 15, 2016, China\\u2019s Ambassador to Iran conducted an on-site project inspection. Then, after Iran\\u2019s Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Akhoundi ordered the redesign of the railway route to make it more efficient compared to the previous design (including the relocation of the train stations in Tehran, Qom and Isfahan), a project (re)design contract was signed on November 27, 2016. The project\\u2019s originally expected completion rate was August 2021. However, as of May 2021, the project had only achieved a 5% completion rate.\",\"On June 25, 2012, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Argentina's Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $2,099,965,834 syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit facility (loan) agreement for the Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Rehabilitation Project. CDB contributed $1,899,965.834 to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#36517) and ICBC contributed $200,000,000 to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#69134). The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4.5 year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus an 2.9% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a commitment fee of 0.125%, an an upfront (one-time) management fee of 0.20%. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy from Sinosure worth 7.21% of the face value of the loan ($151,407,536.63).   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $2,470,548,040 commercial contract between Argentina\\u2019s Ministry of the Interior and Transport and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on March 11, 2010.   As of May 2022, the loan had achieved an 88.3% disbursement rate ($1,855,660,000 out of $2,099,965,834). The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $504,821,918.39 as of December 31, 2015, $1,230,795,697.28 as of December 31, 2017, $1,478,957,102.66 as of December 31, 2019 and $1,376,381,351.22 as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to replace 1593 km of track along the Belgrano Freight Railway, which stretches from Retiro station in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires through a total of 14 Argentine provinces: Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, C\\u00f3rdoba, San Luis, Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Tucum\\u00e1n, Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy. The rail network even connects with two neighboring countries: one of its branches links with Chile through the Socompa border crossing in Salta province, continuing to the port of Antofagasta on the Pacific. There are two alternative connections with Bolivia, neither of which are currently operating. The first is through La Quiaca in Jujuy province, the second through Salvador Mazza in Salta province. The project also involves the acquisition of 1000 wagons and 30 locomotives. This project will be implemented as part of the Argentine government\\u2019s Belgrano Plan, which is a set of transportation, infrastructure, production, health, employment, housing, and education policies and programs that target the country's northern provinces.  The rail replacement works is scheduled to take place in three phases. Work on the first phase will cover 535 km and it includes the Santurce-Tostado-Chorotis-Las Bre\\u00f1as section, the Pampa del Infierno-Los Frentones section, and the Los Pirpintos-Los Tigres-Taco Pozo sections in Santa Fe, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero provinces. Work on the second phase is 500 km in length and it includes the Coronda-Santo Tom\\u00e9 and Laguna Paiva-Nar\\u00e9 sections, both in Santa Fe province, and Talavera-Pichanal-Embarcaci\\u00f3n-Chalic\\u00e1n, between Salta and Jujuy. The third phase of the project is 558 km in length and it includes refurbishment of the Tucum\\u00e1n-Met\\u00e1n-Joaqu\\u00edn V. Gonz\\u00e1lez and Met\\u00e1n-Chalic\\u00e1n sections in Tucum\\u00e1n, Salta, and Jujuy provinces. These activities are expected to generate 23,000 jobs, including both direct and indirect employment. The project implies major logistical work, including the transportation of more than 2 million sleepers, 170,000 tons of rail, and 5 million tons of ballast stone.   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corporation (CSR) and CRRC Qishuyan \\u2014a subsidiary of the CRRC Corporation Limited \\u2014are also involved in the project as subcontractors.   An official project commencement ceremony took place on July 18, 2014. However, construction activities did not begin until December 2014. The project was originally expected to reach completion within two years (December 2016). CMEC had delivered 107 locomotives and 2500 carriages by February 2017.  Then, in January 2018, locomotives manufactured by China's CRRC Qishuyan, arrived in Argentina. On May 31, 2019, President Macri attended the inauguration ceremony of the first 700 km of renewed railway tracks of the Belgrano Cargas train in the town of Joaquin V. Gonzalez in Salta province. As of May 2022, the project had achieved a 77.96% completion rate.   The Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Rehabilitation Project was at risk of cancellation and loan default in 2016. On July 18, 2014, Argentina\\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $4,714,350,000 syndicated term loan facility agreement with three Chinese state-owned banks (Bank of China, China Development Bank, and ICBC) for the construction of two hydroelectric dams (the so-called Kirchner-Cepernic dams) on the Santa Cruz River in Patagonia. The loan agreement included a cross-default clause, stating that if the borrower canceled the project, CDB financing for a separate project (the $2,099,965,834 loan for the Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Project) would also be cancelled. In November 2015, newly elected Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced his intention to suspend the construction of the Kirchner-Cepernic dams. These dams are located on the Santa Cruz River near the famous Perito Moreno Glacier (UNESCO World Heritage Site) that feeds from the same river, and the Macri administration considered these dams to be too risky on environmental grounds. When President Macri first announced his intention to suspend the project, CDB, ICBC, and Bank of China had already disbursed $950 million under the syndicated term loan agreement.   Then, on March 10, 2016, CDB sent a warning letter to Argentina's Finance Minister, Alfonso Prat Gay, The letter said: \\\"The Kirchner-Cepernic dams and the Belgrano Cargas are major projects promoted by the Chinese Communist Party and signed during the same political time period in Argentina and each one of the ... facility agreements contain cross-default clauses.\\\" The Macri administration subsequently reversed course and announced that it no longer intended to suspend construction of the Nestor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Dams.  On January 19, 2022, an MOU was signed between the Ministry of Transport, the Administraci\\u00f3n de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias Sociedad del Estado, and China Railway International Group Co., Ltd. regarding cooperation in railway matters. This was signed so as to carry out the Modernization and Electrification Project of the Belgrano Norte Railway.\",\"On October 13, 2015, Petr\\u00f3leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) announced the conclusion of successful negotiations on a $2 billion financing agreement with ICBC Financial Leasing Co., Ltd. (ICBCFL; ICBC Leasing). The sale and leaseback agreement spans 10 years and provides a financial lease for two of Petrobras' existing deep-water oil platforms (P-52 and P-57) from its wholly-owned subsidiary Petrobras Netherlands B.V. (PNBV). The funds were to be made available to Petrobras once both parties fulfilled the precedent conditions of the agreement.   Then, on March 8, 2016, Petrobras received $1 billion from ICBC Leasing in exchange for the P-52 offshore oil platform, per the October 2015 agreement. The P-52  offshore oil platform was sold to the bank (ICBC Leasing) and the debt was to be settled by lease payments. The transaction had a 10 year maturity. Full ownership of the oil platform was to be transferred back to Petrobras by the end of the lease term in March 2026. Then, on September 10, 2018, Petrobras prepaid $750 million for financial leasing on P-52 despite the original maturity of March 2026.   The P-52 oil platform is located in Roncador oil field in Brazil\\u2019s Campos Basin. The P-57 oil platform is located in Jubarte oil field.\",\"On March 22, 2013, PJSC Rosneft Oil Company (\\u2018Rosneft\\u2019) \\u2014 a Russian state-owned oil company \\u2014 and China Development Bank (CDB) signed a framework facilities agreement. Then, on June 21, 2013, Rosneft announced that it had signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement with CDB. The facility agreement was signed by Rosneft President and Chairman of the Management Board Igor Sechin and President of China Development Bank Zheng Zhijie as part of the visit of Xi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China, to Russia. The loan carries a 16 year maturity (and a final maturity date of May 2029) and an unknown interest rate. It was secured (collateralized) with a contract for crude oil supplies signed by Rosneft and CNPC in 2009. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower for the development of Vankor field (an oil and gas field in Turukhansk District and Krasnoyarsk Krai within Eastern Siberia) and to facilitate the supply of gas to China. OJSC VTB Bank was the agent and passport bank for the loan.   On July 29, 2013, Rosneft disclosed that the $2 billion loan from CDB had fully disbursed in June 2013. \",\"In 2009, Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries (KPI) LLP signed an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinopec Engineering Co., Ltd. (through Sinopec Group subsidiary China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation) for the first stage of construction of Atyrau petrochemical project. On February 22, 2011, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK) entered into a $1.4 billion credit agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China to finance the construction of an integrated petrochemical project in the Atyrau Region of Kazakstan. However, as of 2017, no amounts had been drawn down under this credit agreement. This was due to the mutual termination of the EPC contract between KPI and Sinopec in 2014. Therefore, AidData assumes that the China Eximbank loan was canceled (since the proceeds of this loan were to be used to fund the EPC contract with Sinopec). The loan cancellation is captured via Project ID#40266.  Then, in December 2015, China National Chemical Engineering Corporation (CNCEC) signed an EPC contract with KPI to construct an integrated gas-chemical complex in the Atyrau Region on a turnkey basis.  On September 3, 2016, the Xinjiang Branch of China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $2 billion loan agreement with KPI for the construction of the complex. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years and an interest rate of 5.8%. National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC provided a guarantee for this loan on February 13, 2017. The loan was also secured by (i.e. collateralized with) all current and future assets of KPI. On November 24, 2017, CDB sent an advance payment of $409 million to CNCEC. The project had a total cost of $2.6 billion; the CDB bank loan covered the entire cost of the $1.795 billion EPC contract with CNCEC; the remainder of the financing of the project was provided by the organizers of the project, KPI and its ownership.  KPI was the project company (special purpose vehicle) responsible for the financing, design, and construction of the Atyrau Petrochemical Complex Construction Project. KPI was 99% owned by United Chemical Company LLP, a subsidiary of JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna; the remaining 1% of KPI LLP was owned by a private investor, \\\"Firm Almex Plus\\u201d LLP, part of  part of one of the largest holding groups in Kazakhstan - \\u201cALMEX Holding Group\\u201d Joint-Stock Company.  42 construction and installation companies were involved in the construction and installation work; 39 of which were Kazakhstani and 3 of which were foreign. The Kazakhstani companies included AtyrauNefteMash LLP, which produced the propane and propylene splitter, \\\"Petropavlovsk Plant of Heavy Machine Building\\\" JSC and Sewon-Vertex Heavy Industries received orders for the production of 35 units and heat exchangers with a total weight. Imstalcon JSC participated in the manufacture of equipment for the project, while the Kazakh Institute of Oil and Gas JSC participated in the design of the complex. Chicago Bridge & Iron Company (CB&I) received the PMC contract for project management. The project was transferred from Samruk-Kazyna to the trust management of JSC NC KazMunayGas (KMG) in June 2018.  Upon completion, the petrochemical complex was expected to produce 500,000 tons of polypropylene per year and be the first integrated gas-chemical complex in Kazakhstan. The plant was expected to go online in 2020. On November 27, 2017, KPI sent a notice of the start of construction work to the general contractor. The message was received and work began on December 11, 2017. As of October 2020, the project had achieved a 77% completion rate and it was expected to be fully complete in 2021 In June 2021, the project had achieved a completion rate of nearly 90%.\",\"On October 13, 2013, Harbin Electric International Engineering Co., Ltd. (HEI) and Vinh Tan 3 Energy Joint Stock Company (VTEC) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture between OneEnergy Ventures Limited (49% ownership stake), Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (29% ownership stake), and Thai Binh Duong Group (Pacific Corp) (22% ownership stake) \\u2014 signed a framework cooperation agreement for the 1980MW Vinh Tan 3 Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. Then, in November 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) and signed a Financing Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for this project.   Then, in September 2016, five Chinese state-owned banks and VTEC signed a $2 billion syndicated loan agreement for the 1980MW Vinh Tan 3 Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. Chinese members of the syndicate included China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China (BoC) and Bank of Communications (BoComm). CDB was the mandated lead arranger and Sinosure provided export buyer\\u2019s credit insurance. The borrowing terms of the non-recourse loan are unknown.   The borrower used the proceeds from the syndicated loan to partially finance an EPC contract signed on June 23, 2015 with Harbin Electric International Company. The purpose of the project was to construct a 1980MW coal-fired power plant \\u2014 with three power generation units (Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 3) \\u2014 in V\\u0129nh T\\u00e2n commune, Tuy Phong district, and B\\u00ecnh Thu\\u1eadn province.   In December 2019, CLP announced that it would no longer invest in new coal-fired power plants, thereby raising questions about the financial viability of the 1980MW Vinh Tan 3 Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. Then, in January 2020, HSBC announced that it would join Standard Chartered Bank and not participate in the syndicated loan supporting the 1980MW Vinh Tan 3 Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. It did so on environmental grounds. Then, in February 2021, Mitsubishi Corporation announced that it was withdrawing from the project, which was reportedly the first time it had ever withdrawn from a coal-fired plant project.   As of September 2020, the 1980MW Vinh Tan 3 Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project had still not entered the construction stage and the power plant was expected to be operational in 2024.\",\"On May 9, 2014, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $2.5 billion master facility agreement with the Government of Angola.   The agreement is a master agreement under which the Government of Angola and CDB may conclude individual loan agreements (ILAs) for the purpose of financing up to 85% of the contract price owing to certain approved contractors in respect of certain approved infrastructure projects in Angola, primarily in the areas of housing, transportation, agriculture, roads and railways, hospitals, schools, telecommunication, water and electricity, sanitation and other human livelihood areas agreed by CDB and Angola. Each individual (subsidiary) loan approved through the facility must be for a minimum of $10 million and have a maturity of 10 years.   As of December 31, 2017, $2,199,500,000 was drawn down under the MLFA. The (principal) amount outstanding under the MLFA was $300.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The availability period for drawdowns under this master facility agreement ended on May 9, 2017. However, it was later extended until 2021.   Projects that may have been funded through the master facility agreement include: 1. Construction of access roads to Luanda International Airport (Project ID#65307) 2. Rehabilitation of New Luanda International Airport (Project ID#72349)  There are indications that the May 2014 CDB loan financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015. The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2\\u20132023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024\\u201325. The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account \\u2014 known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) \\u2014 to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023.\",\"On November 18, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) issued a $2.2 billion loan to P\\u00e9troleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) for several major projects, including (1) a Dehydration and Desalination Plant in Anzo\\u00e1tegui and (2) Expansion of Jose Processing Plant in Anzo\\u00e1tegui. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) PDVSA income from oil sales to China.   Several sources also suggest that the borrower was allowed to use the loan proceeds to increase oil exports to China through three CNPC-PDVSA joint ventures (Petrourica, Petrozumano, and Sinovensa).   The desalination plant in Anzo\\u00e1tegui was formally inaugurated on November 23, 2017. The Jose Processing Plant was supposed to increase production to at least 330,000 bpd of extra heavy crude oil by 2017.\",\"On July 24, 2018, China Development Bank (CDB) and Eskom \\u2014 South Africa's state-owned energy utility company \\u2014 signed a $2.5 billion loan (term facility) agreement for the 4800MW Kusile Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 3.7149% interest rate. The borrower is expected to make 20, equal semiannual installments (on March 12 and September 12 of each year) over a 10 year period (after the expiration of the grace period). The South African Government issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. However, the interest rate and other key terms and conditions in the loan agreement remain unavailable, as President Ramaphosa indicated that this information will not be made public due to confidentiality clauses. The successful conclusion of the $2.5 billion CDB loan agreement brought Eskom in line with the company\\u2019s commitment to secure 62% of its financial year 2018/19 funding requirement. By the end of 2021, the loan\\u2019s estimated disbursement rate was 83.62%.   The purpose of the project is to construct the Kusile coal-fired power station (plant), which contains six units with about 800MW capacity each, totaling about 4800MW in the La Faral area of Limpopo, South Africa. The project also includes a power station precinct, power station buildings, administrative buildings, roads, and a high-voltage yard. The total cost of the project is $19.1 billion.   Construction of the Kusile Station commenced on June 5, 2007. However, by April 2011, the project had only achieved a 21% completion rate. In 2015, it was reported that Unit 1 would come online in 2016 and the last unit would come online by 2021. However, the project was still being implemented as of 2022. The expected completion year of the Kusile Power Station is now 2026 (after being pushed back from its originally scheduled completion date of 2023).   Project delays have resulted from the financial management problems of Eskom and the termination of a turbines contract with Alstom. According to IJGlobal, in the 11 years since the project was announced, it has attracted no fewer than 22 banks, export credit agencies, and investment funds all of which offered different services, such as Bank of America (advisory service); Deutsche Bank (loan); JP Morgan (funding plan adviser); Barclays (advisory service); Credit Suisse Group (transaction adviser); Societe Generale (loan); and China Development Bank (loan). The loan from the China Development Bank came at an opportune time as many banks and insurers in Europe, the US, and Japan have in the past few years announced changes to their energy investment policies to exclude financing for new coal-fired power projects.  There are some indications that the $2.5 billion CDB loan for the 4800MW Kusile Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In February 2019, the CEO of Eskom was asked the following question by a reporter: 'Can you indicate and comment in general terms on the World Bank, DBSA, China Development Bank and other DFI loan covenants, and what may be considered a breach, such as failure to meet required going concern status, debt service coverage ratio and/or other metrics?' He responded that 'I am cautious not to breach the confidentiality of the lenders, but generally speaking, the going-concern status of Eskom is informed by normal credit metrics \\u2014 interest cover, debt service cover, and so on. When we do find ourselves in a situation where we will not meet these requirements, many of the terms do allow us to put forward an action plan on how it\\u2019s going to be resolved.' Then, in February 2023, South Africa\\u2019s National Treasury announced that it would would take on ZAR 254 billion ($14 billion) of Eskom's ZAR 423 billion debt that was at risk of default, to enable the state-owned power utility to pay down its principal and interest obligations.\",\"The Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail (HSR) Project was originally going to be financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). In January 2014, JICA included the project in its Overseas Development Aid plan for Indonesia and agreed in principle to bankroll 75% of the total cost of the project at a 0.1% interest rate so long as the host government provided a loan repayment guarantee. However, Beijing was determined to win the contract for the HSR project and sought to outcompete Tokyo on several dimensions, including cost, speed of implementation, and level of public liability. In early 2015, Indonesian President Joko Jokowi invited China to submit an alternative proposal, and it proposed a lower cost version of the project that could be fully-financed with a government-guaranteed (CDB) loan at a 2% interest rate and implemented on a shorter timeline (3 years rather than 5 years).   Then, in September 2015, when President Jokowi was expected to announce the winning bidder, he surprised everyone by rejecting Beijing\\u2019s offer and Tokyo\\u2019s offer and \\u201ccancelling\\u201d the project. The stated rationale for his decision was that the project would lead to a ballooning of public debt. Tokyo responded by offering a 50% reduction in the amount of debt that would need to be backed by a sovereign guarantee. Beijing responded by scrapping the sovereign guarantee requirement altogether and proposing an off-public balance sheet transaction, in which CDB would work around the country\\u2019s public debt ceiling by extending a loan to a special purpose vehicle (jointly owned by Chinese and Indonesian state-owned companies) rather than the Government of Indonesia. Beijing\\u2019s revised offer was sufficiently attractive to seal the deal.   On October 16, 2015, a consortium of Indonesian state-owned companies (called PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN) and a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies (called Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd) established a joint venture and special purpose vehicle called PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (also known as PT Kereta Api Indonesia China or KCIC) to design, finance, implement, and manage the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project. PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN (PSBI) \\u2014 a joint venture of PT Wijaya Karya Tbk (38% ownership stake), PT Kereta Api Indonesia (25% ownership stake), PT Perkebunan Nusantara VIII (25% ownership stake), and PT Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk. (12%) ownership stake \\u2014 holds a 60% ownership stake (shareholding interest) in KCIC. Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd \\u2014 a joint venture of China Railway International Co. Ltd., China Railway Group Limited, Sinohydro Corporation Limited, CRRC Corporation Limited, and China Railway Signal and Communication Corp. \\u2014 holds the remaining 40% ownership stake (shareholding interest) in KCIC. Then, on May 14, 2017, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $3.9675 billion loan agreement with KCIC for the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail Project.   The loan consists of two tranches: a USD-denominated tranche worth $2.3805 billion (captured via Project ID#61320) and an RMB-denominated tranche worth $1.587 billion (captured via Project ID#61321). The USD-denominated tranche carries the following borrowing terms: 40-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and no sovereign guarantee. The RMB-denominated tranche carries the following borrowing terms: 40-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 3.46% interest rate, and no sovereign guarantee. ICBC is the security agent for the loan. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an EPC contract between KCIC and seven Indonesian and Chinese state-owned firms, which was signed on April 4, 2017. The total cost of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project is $5.29 billion and it is being financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. The equity contribution of Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd. is captured via Project ID#61322.   The purpose of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project is to construct a 142.3 km high-speed railway from the city of Jakarta to Bandung, the capital of West Java. Upon completion, the railway is expected to reduce the travel time between Jakarta and Bandung from more than 3 hours to less than 40 minutes. Construction began on January 21, 2016. However, the first CDB loan disbursement ($170 million) did not occur until May 2018. CDB planned to disburse another $1.1 billion before the end of July 2018. In May 2019, the 608-meter Walini tunnel was built. By September 2019, 32.8% of the project\\u2019s construction activities were complete and land acquisition progress reached 99%. By mid-February 2020, construction progress had reached 44% and land acquisition progress reached 99.96%. Then, in March 2020, the 442-meter No.5 tunnel was finished. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, work on the project was temporarily halted during the spring of 2020. Construction resumed in June 2020, and as of September 2020, the Director of KCIC Xin Xuezhong reported that construction progress had reached 60% and land acquisition progress had reached 100%.   The Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project, which was originally scheduled for completion in May 2019, has encountered a number of different problems during implementation. First, Indonesia Law No. 32/2009 regarding Environment Management and Control requires an environmental impact assessment (EIA) be developed over at least one year (and include analysis for both dry and rainy seasons) for a project of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR\\u2019s scale. However, the EIA for the project was completed in less than 6 months, and environmental NGOs claim that it contains inaccurate and flawed data analysis regarding the project\\u2019s actual environmental impacts. Second, the project reportedly violated Government Regulation No. 27/2012 regarding environmental permits, which requires public participation in the making of the EIA document. Environmental NGOs claim that, due to a lack of public participation in the EIA process, the project has serious design defects, including a planned route through numerous geological faults, which has led to delays, cost overruns, and local opposition. Third, although KCIC exclusively appointed PT Pilar Sinergi, a state-owned enterprise to deal with land acquisition issues, the process has not proceeded as smoothly as the Indonesian government had hoped. In July 2018, three lawsuits resulted in legal approval from the courts to proceed with claims seeking compensation for their properties affected by the project. Fourth, Indonesia\\u2019s Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR) ordered a temporary halt to the project on March 2, 2020 after flooding blocked the main toll road between Jakarta and the city of Cikampe. Acting Director General of Public Works Danis Sumadilaga said piles of soil dumped on roadsides had buried drainage channels and caused the flooding, adding that shoddy management practices paid scant attention to health, safety, and environmental degradation concerns. Fifth, during the construction process, gas pipelines owned by the national Pertamina Oil Company were damaged, which caused an explosion and killed a Chinese worker in Melong, near Cimahi town. Sixth, blasting work for tunnels in the area of the Tipar Sari Asih housing complex in the West Java town of Cimahi has caused serious damage. According to Meiki Paendong, executive director of WALHI West Java, an environmental NGO based in Bandung, \\u201c[m]any walls of [nearby] houses cracked \\u2026 [and] there was information that [the company] would examine the impact, but until now, the results of the inspection have not been made public.\\u201d Seventh, when flooding hit the Jakarta suburb of Bekasi in January 2020, Deputy Mayor Tri Ardhianto Tjahyono pointed to the HSR project as a cause, as did officials in the West Bandung regency which also flooded. Arief Maulana, head of Bekasi City Public Works and Water Management, said that \\u201c[o]ne of KCIC effects\\u2026 is the problem of drainage control in several project activity locations, which are close to the drainage area that causes sedimentation and also disrupted waterways.\\u201d Maulana argued that it is the responsibility of KCIC to fix all drainage damage due to the project. KCIC eventually agreed to repair and restore the drainage system after the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry demanded an assessment of the project in March 2020, due to environmental degradation concerns. Meiki Paendong, executive director of WALHI West Java, argues that the flooding in Bekasi and elsewhere demonstrated that the project\\u2019s EIA was flawed, as it failed to address the closure and loss of drainage flows due to land-use change. For example, drainage canals were covered by landfills, which reportedly increased flooding throughout the rainy season.   In 2015, Indonesian President Joko Jokowi signed a decree prohibiting the use of government funds for the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project. However, during implementation, the project encountered major cost overruns worth an estimated $2 billion due to various factors, including but not limited to higher-than-expected land procurement costs, delays in construction due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the rising prices of materials, and additional project insurance costs and debt service reserve account (DSRA) requirements. Then, in October 2021, President Jokowi reversed course, issuing a new decree and authorizing a government bailout of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project. The Indonesian government reportedly authorized the use of $286.7 million from state coffers to inject liquidity into PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (the borrowing institution) in the next fiscal year. It also made clear that it was prepared to provide additional funding on an as needed basis. At the time, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), said that \\u2018like it or not, \\u2026 we have to ask the government to participate in funding the project if we want it to be finished on time.\\u2019 Then, in July 2022, the project\\u2019s prime contractor (PT KCIC) reported that the project had achieved an 85% completion rate. At that time, Jakarta-Bandung HSR saw the laying of ballasted tracks begin on its main line. One month later, in August 2022, high-speed bullet trains for the Indonesian Jakarta-Bandung HSR rolled off the assembly line in Qingdao within China\\u2019s Shandong Province. Eleven pairs of high-speed electric multiple units (EMUs) and one set of comprehensive testing bullet railcars were ready to be shipped to Indonesia.   As of August 2022, all Jakarta-Bandung HSR tunnels had been completed and more than 90 percent of the subgrade, bridge and station civil works had been completed. By October 2022, the project had achieved a 88.8% completion rate. Also, during the last quarter of calendar year 2022, Indonesian state auditor BPKP reported that the cost overruns associated with the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project were just under $1.5 billion (rather than the earlier estimate of $2 billion). On October 18, 2022, Indonesia\\u2019s Deputy Minister of SOEs Kartiko Wirjoatmodjo announced that \\u2018[w]e are currently in the final negotiation with CDB for additional loans for cost overruns'. He also indicated that KCIC would contract one or more supplementary loans worth $1.03 billion (IDR 16.1 trillion) from CDB to cover approximately 75% of the project\\u2019s cost overruns (worth $1.45 billion). Then, on November 9, 2022, KCIC Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi told a legislative committee that the project\\u2019s cash flow would run out by the end of the month and China\\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) agreed that 75% of the project\\u2019s cost overruns should be funded with the proceeds of an additional CDB loan. At the time, KCIC was also asking parliament to make another IDR 3.22 million cash injection into the project company (as an additional equity contribution on behalf of PSBI) in conjunction with an additional IDR 2.15 trillion equity contribution from Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd. KCIC Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi told the legislative committee that completing the project by June 2023 would require receipt of additional project debt and equity by the end of November 2022.   On March 31, 2023, the track laying of the whole line of the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway was completed. Then, on April 10, 2023, Indonesia' Chief Investment Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said that KCIC had been working with CDB to lower the interest rate attached to the supplementary loan to cover the project's cost overruns. The Indonesian Government proposed a $560 million loan at a 2%interest rate from China Development Bank (CDB) to pay for the cost overruns. In April 2023, Luhut told a press briefing in Jakarta that '[CDB] is already willing to bring the interest down from 4 percent. The first offer is a reduction from 4 percent to 3.4 percent, but we want it to be even lower. [...] We do want a 2 percent interest, but it is impossible to have everything [we want] come true. If you ask for loans [outside China], the interest can go up to 6 percent. So if we end up with a 3.4-percent rate, we are doing okay, although not that okay. But that would be better than [borrowing money from other countries].' Luhut also noted that a 3.4 percent interest rate would not necessarily be problematic: 'Do not underestimate our country. We are getting better. Our state tax revenue has grown by 48.6 percent [in January 2023] thanks to better efficiency with digitalization, etc.'  As of April 2023, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway was expected to launch its commercial operations on August 18, 2023 \\u2014 one day after the 78th anniversary of Indonesia's independence day.  Then, in May 2023, Indonesia\\u2019s Transport Ministry and three consulting firms -- Mott MacDonald, PwC and local law firm Umbra -- pushed back on the suggestion that the project could achieve full-fledged commercial operations by August 18, 2023. At the time, the Chinese participants in KCIC reportedly wanted a full operational worthiness certificate for the Jakarta-Bandung HSC despite the incomplete construction of a railway station, but the Indonesian Transport Ministry and its consultants suggested that KCIC might not achieve full-fledged commercial operations until December 31, 2023.   Then, in June 2023, Reuters reported that KCIC was still in negotiations with CDB over a $560 million supplemental loan (captured via captured via Project ID#96344). After CDB offered an interest rate of 3.46% on the loan's RMB-denominated tranche, KCIC reportedly countered with a 2.8% interest rate request.\",\"In January 2015, the Chinese Government proposed loans worth $15 to $20 billion to finance the expansion of various railways in Bangladesh. Soon thereafter, Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways sent a set of projects to the Economic Relations Division (ERD) of Bangladesh's Ministry of Finance to inquire about potential Chinese financing. Then, Bangladesh\\u2019s Ministry of Finance sent a list of projects, including the Padma Bridge Rail Project, to the Chinese Government. At that point, Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways had already signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with China Railway Group Limited for the Padma Bridge Rail Project. Then, on August 8, 2016, Bangladesh Railway and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) signed a $3.13 billion commercial contract for the construction of a 172-kilometer-long railway line from Dhaka to Jessore crossing through the Padma Bridge. Two months later, in October 2016, during the state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Bangladesh, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed an MoU on the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project.    However, the project hit a snag because of disagreements between the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh on the face value and interest rate of the proposed loan for the project. The Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways requested that the project begin implementation in January 2017 in order to be completed by the time the Padma Bridge was completed. However, a loan agreement with China Eximbank had yet to be signed and was scheduled to be signed on December 16, 2017. This date came and past, despite attempts of Bangladeshi authorities \\u2014 including the Prime Minister's Office \\u2014 to contact their Chinese counterparts to finalize the loan. The Government of Bangladesh had wanted the project to be completed before Bangladesh's December 2018 general elections.    Specific issues relating to the face value of the loan were related to major increases in the cost of land acquisition. China Eximbank disagreed with the Government of Bangladesh over the costs of the land acquisition. As a result, China Eximbank reduced the promised loan amount by 15% (from approximately \\u09f3247.490 billion BDT to \\u09f3210.36 billion BDT) and turned its previously promised \\u2018soft loan\\u2019 (most likely a governmental concessional loan) into a preferential buyer's credit. As a result, the Government of Bangladesh was forced to increase its counterpart funding contribution from \\u09f3102 billion BDT to \\u09f3190.43 billion BDT.    Then, on February 2, 2018, China Eximbank sent a letter to the Government of Bangladesh informing them that it would begin the process of signing the loan agreement. To ensure that China Eximbank would issue the loan for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project promptly, in early February 2018 (presumably after the China Eximbank letter was received), the Government of Bangladesh approved \\u2018on an urgent basis\\u2019 a China Eximbank government concessional loan worth RMB 1,547,071,939.09 ($231.5 million) for the Modernization of Telecommunication Network for Digital Connectivity Project (MOTN) (captured via Project ID#52765) because the \\u2018[d]elay in offering the green signal to the Chinese assistance [for the telecommunications modernization project] was affecting the implementation of the [Padma Bridge Rail Link Project].\\u2019 The Government of Bangladesh had previous problems with the MOTN loan and delayed approving it, which provoked concerns among the Chinese authorities. To address these concerns and advance the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, the Government of Bangladesh approved the MOTN loan. Then, China\\u2019s State Council provided its approval for China Eximbank to issue a loan for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project in February 2018. The Chinese Government sent the loan agreement to the Bangladeshi Government by the end of February for final review and countersignature.    Then, on April 27, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed the $2,667,940,000 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project (PBRLP). The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a grace period of 6 years, a maturity period of 20 years, a management fee of 0.25%, and a commitment fee of 0.25%. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $3,138,750,000 commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh and CREC, which was signed in August 2016. The Government of Bangladesh is responsible for covering the remaining 15% ($470.81 million).    According to the Government of Bangladesh\\u2019s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the PBC had achieved a disbursement rate of 20% ($533,588,000 out of $2,667,940,000) as of June 30, 2020 and a 40.4% disbursement rate ($1,079,727,000 out of $2,667,940,000) as of June 30, 2021.  According to the Government of Bangladesh\\u2019s ERD, the borrower had not made any repayments under the PBC as of June 30, 2021. The purpose of the project is to construct a new railway track that runs from the city of Dhaka to the city of Jessore via Padma Multipurpose Bridge to establish new Broad Gauge (BG) railway connectivity through south-west part of the country. The project is being implemented in 2 phases. The first phase is an 82 kilometer section from Dhaka to Bhanga, and the second phase is a Bhanga to Jessore section. The project involves the construction of 215.22 km of rail track, including loops and sidings; 23.38 km of viaducts, 1.98 km of ramps, 66 major bridges, 244 minor bridges and culverts, 1 highway overpass, and 29 level crossings. The project also includes the construction of 14 new station buildings, remodeling of 6 existing station buildings, the supply of 100 passenger coaches, and the acquisition of 1796 acres of land. 172 kilometer of track is to be laid between Dhaka to Jessore via Padam Bridge and Bhanga of Faridpur, while 43.2 km of track was set to be lines loop lines. 23 kilometers of the rail line is set to be elevated. The single-track rail line is designed to accommodate a maximum speed of 120 kilometers per hour. Construction of the railway is expected to impact the living accommodations of 7,705 people, necessitating resettlement arrangements.    The PBRLP seeks to establish a rail-based transportation network with nine southern districts including the Port of Mongla and Benapole Land Port through the 6.15-kilometer Padma Bridge (which was still under construction when this project began implementation). The route is to be constructed in four sections: Dhaka-Gendaria, Gendaria-Mawa, Mawa-Bhanga junction via Padma Bridge and Bhanga-Jessore Bridge. The 50-kilometer-long Mawa-Bhanga junction-Bhanga via Padma Bridge section was originally expected to be completed by the end of 2018 to allow trains to travel over the bridge on the day of its inauguration. The project, part of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM) of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is expected to cut the travel time from Dhaka to Kolkata, West Bengal, India by five hours and time from Dhaka to Khulna in southern Bangladesh from nine hours to 3 hours.  CREC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. China Railway First Group Co, Ltd. (CRFG) \\u2014 a subsidiary of China Railway Group Limited \\u2014 is also involved in project implementation. The Engineering Corps of Bangladesh Army and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology have also served as consultants for the project. Bangladesh Railway is the main executing agency on behalf of the Bangladeshi Government, while Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways (MoR) is the \\u2018sponsoring ministry.\\u2019 After the signing of the loan agreement, construction was placed under the supervision of Fast Track Project Monitoring Committee, headed by Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina.    Project implementation commenced on July 3, 2018, with an intended completion date of June 2022. However, even by May 2018, before implementation had commenced, Bangladesh Railways officials were attempting to secure an extension of implementation from June 2022 to June 2024 due to the previously described delays relating to the loan. Prime Minister Hasina officially inaugurated work on the project on October 14, 2018, despite the commencement of construction works several months prior.     By November 2020, the project had achieved a 28.28% completion rate, despite the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The expected project completion date at that time was June 2024, and the Mawa-Bhanga junction-Bhanga via Padma Bridge section was to be set to be open in 2021 (although this section was originally scheduled to be opened by the end of 2018). On August 23, 2021, the installation of all road slabs on Padma Bridge was completed. In total, 2,917 road slabs and 2,959 railway slabs were installed on the 6.15 km-long bridge. As of November 2021, the physical works of the main structure of the Padma Bridge had achieved a 95% completion rate and the overall progress of the bridge construction stood at an 88.75% completion rate. Asphalt carpeting on the road slabs also began in November 2021.\",\"In 2014, Egyptian President el-Sisi proposed the construction of a New Administrative Capital (NAC) and identified this project as the \\u2018the locomotive of Egypt's future development.\\u2019 The project is part of a broader effort to switch Egypt\\u2019s capital city from Cairo to a brand-new constructed smart city called the NAC. The establishment of the NAC seeks to alleviate Greater Cairo\\u2019s increasing densification and establish a new growth hub for future generations. It will house Egypt\\u2019s 29 government ministries and contain 20 residential neighborhoods, an airport, hotels, malls, parks. Upon completion, it is projected to have enough space to accommodate 6.5 million inhabitants. In January 2016, the Egyptian Government and China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) signed a general contracting framework agreement regarding a project to construct the Central Business District (CBD) of the NAC. Then, on October 11, 2017, at a launch ceremony for the NAC Project, Egyptian Minister of Housing, Public Facilities, and Urban Development, Mustafa Mabdili, signed a general (commercial) contract worth $3,000,000,000 for the construction of the Central Business District (CBD) of the NAC with the Vice President of CSCEC, Zheng Xuexuan. The contract specifies that CSCEC is responsible for the construction of 18 high-rise towers (including administrative offices, hotels, entertainment facilities, and the tallest tower in Africa), which were organized into three batches and scheduled for financing via three separate loan tranches (all of which have reached financial close).    Then, on April 28, 2019, a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks signed a $2.76 billion syndicated (buyer\\u2019s credit) loan agreement with the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) \\u2014 an Egyptian Government authority affiliated with the Ministry of Housing \\u2014 for the construction of the Central Business District (CBD) in the NAC. Participants in the loan syndicate include the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and Bank of China (BOC). ICBC is the lead arranger of the syndicated loan and it contributed $610 million to the syndicate. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of the $3,000,000,000 commercial contract that was signed with CSCEC on October 11, 2017. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 13.5-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and 2-3% interest rate.  The Government of Egypt reportedly provided a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. Sinosure provided $3.88 billion of buyer\\u2019s credit insurance (to cover the loan\\u2019s principal and interest). The Sinosure-covered project cashflow analysis reportedly accounted for projected apartment rental and sales, hotel & retail rentals, and centralized advertising revenues. The first tranche of the syndicated loan\\u2019s three tranches was worth $843,000,000 and it was earmarked for the construction of seven high-rise towers (5 residential and 2 commercial towers) in the CBD. Then, in July 2019, NUCA signed an agreement with eight Chinese banks (including ICBC) and HSBC Bank Middle East Limited to receive the second tranche of the loan (also known as the \\u201cBatch 2 Towers\\u201d Project). On December 24, 2020, the Egyptian Government announced that the third and final loan tranche would soon be disbursed and NUCA signed an agreement with seven Chinese banks (including ICBC, Bank of China, China Eximbank, China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications, Postal Savings Bank of China, and China CITIC Bank) to receive the third tranche of the loan (also known as the \\u201cBatch 3 Towers\\u201d Project). The first tranche was due to be disbursed in January 2020. However, on January 31, 2020, Al Monitor \\u2014 an Egyptian newspaper \\u2014 reported that the first tranche of the loan had not disbursed as expected in January 2020. According to the newspaper, the Egyptian government did not initially meet conditions attached to the loan facility and the Chinese bank syndicate was concerned about whether the Egyptian government could repay the loan.    The CBD is located in the center of Egypt\\u2019s New Administrative Capital, 45 km east of Cairo. The CBD is expected to cover 505,000 m^2, and it include Africa\\u2019s tallest building at 385.8 meter named \\u201cIconic Tower\\u201d (Arabic: \\u0627\\u0644\\u0628\\u0631\\u062c \\u0627\\u0644\\u0623\\u064a\\u0642\\u0648\\u0646\\u064a\\u200e), 12 high rise commercial office buildings, 5 high-rise apartments, 2 hotels, and a total of 18 high rise buildings and municipal projects. CSCEC\\u2019s Eighth Bureau is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and it has reportedly provided direct employment opportunities for 5,000 workers, while indirectly employing 30,000 people.    Dar al-Handasah Shair & Partners is responsible for architectural design and supervision. Project implementation commenced on May 2, 2018. On February 26, 2019, the foundation bottom slab concreting of the main building of the Iconic Tower was completed. In March 2020, the structural frame of the CO3 Office Building was completed and the first curtain wall body was installed for the C04 Tower (Commercial Building), which marked the beginning of the external curtain wall installation stage. Construction activities continued during the Covid-19 pandemic. On October 25, 2020, a topping-off ceremony was held for the 27-floor, C12 Tower (Commercial Building) Then, on June 17, 2021, a topping-off ceremony was held for the 385.8 meter, 80-storey Iconic Tower (which was planned and inspired by the shape of a pharaonic obelisk with glass exterior). CSCEC reported in 2021 that it had completed the construction of 13 buildings in the NAC, including the Iconic Tower (also known as the C03 Tower). As of September 2022, the project had completed the main construction of all 20 buildings and had entered the decoration and electromechanical installation stage. At that time, the project as a whole was expected to reach completion by the end of 2023. However, according to the terms of the commercial contract that was signed on October 11, 2017, the project was originally expected to reach completion within 43 months (by May 11, 2021).\",\"On November 1, 2017, China Development Bank signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Novatek regarding the Arctic LNG 2 Project.  A special purpose vehicle (SPV) and project company \\u2014 called Arctic LNG 2 LLC \\u2014 has been established to finance, design, implement, and operate this project. In September 2020, a group of lenders \\u2014 including France\\u2019s Bpifrance, Germany\\u2019s Euler Hermes, Italy\\u2019s SACE, Russia\\u2019s Sberbank, China Development Bank (CDB), and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) \\u2014 expressed interest in financing the Arctic LNG 2 project. At the time, CDB was expected to offer a $5 billion loan in support of the $21 billion project.    Then, on April 28, 2021, Arctic LNG 2 LLC \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of NOVATEK (60%), Total (10%), CNPC (10%), CNOOC (10%) and the Japan Arctic LNG, consortium of Mitsui & Co, Ltd. and JOGMEC (10%) \\u2014 announced the signing of an EUR 3.11 billion loan agreement with a syndicate of Russian banks, including PJSC Sberbank, Gazprombank (Joint Stock Company) and its subsidiary Bank GPB International S.A., State Development Corporation VEB.RF and \\u00abBank Otkritie Financial Corporation\\u00bb (Public Joint-Stock Company). This loan carries a 15-year maturity and it is apparently collateralized against NOVATEK\\u2019s 60% equity stake in Arctic LNG-2 LLC. As of September 30, 2021, about 52% of the total planned capital expenditures of Arctic LNG 2 Project had been financed. Then, on November 30, 2021, Arctic LNG 2 LLC announced the signing of loan agreements with a group international financial institutions and commercial banks. The maximum aggregate borrowing amount under the loan facilities to be provided by the Russian and international banks is EUR 9.5 billion for up to 15 years. These credit facility agreements including buyer\\u2019s credit facility agreements with China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China worth EUR 2.5 billion. The borrower also purchased buyer\\u2019s credit insurance from Sinosure. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) also issued a loan to Arctic LNG 2.   The loan proceeds are to be used by the borrower to finance an EPC contract with TechnipFMC, which was signed in July 2019.  The purpose of the project is to create a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility consisting of three trains, each using concrete gravity-based structures. The LNG facility will be located in the Gydan Peninsula in Siberia. Upon completion, its expected annual LNG production capacity is 19.8 million metric tons per year. TechnipFMC \\u2014 a joint venture of Technip Energies, Saipem and NIPIGAS \\u2014 is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Wison Offshore and Marine Ltd is a subcontractor involved in the project; its scope of work is engineering, procurement, fabrication, and commissioning of modules in train one with a total weight of 48,000 MT. The project\\u2019s front-end engineering design (FEED) was completed in October 2018. A final investment decision (FID) made in September 2019.   On June 17, 2021, the first plane landed at the Utrenniy airport built specifically for the Arctic LNG 2 project on the Gydan Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region.  Shanghai-based Wison Offshore and Marine Ltd, a subsidiary of privately owned Chinese conglomerate Wison Group, shipped the first two of four giant industrial modules for the Arctic LNG 2 project of Novatek, the largest independent natural gas producer of Russia, on August 26, 2021. The modules dispatched from Zhoushan shipyard were slated to arrive in Russia's Arctic port city of Murmansk after 25 days. On September 21, 2021. Arctic LNG 2 LLC announced that the first modules for LNG Train 1 were successfully delivered. The two first pipe-rack modules weighing approximately nine thousand tons each were shipped from the Zhoushan port in China to the NOVATEK-Murmansk LNG Construction Center and were to be further skidded onto the Gravity Base Structure, or GBS, platform of LNG Train 1. The next two modules were loaded onto a transport ship and put in transit to Murmansk. Overall, 14 modules are schedule to be delivered from contractors' shipyards for the first LNG train. By the end of the third quarter 2021, the project had achieved a 52% completion rate and the first train was roughly 69% complete.   However, the project encountered significant implementation obstacles and delays in 2022. Technip Energies warned in April 2022 that international sanctions (resulting from Russia's military invasion of Ukraine), would complicate the completion of the project. Technip\\u2019s CEO Arnaud Pieton said at the time that '[t]he European sanctions now target LNG goods and technology and services more directly, I would say, making the execution of [Arctic LNG 2] more complicated, maybe even highly complicated.' Then, work on train three was halted on on April 29, 2022 and work on train two was halted on May 27, 2022. All foreign workers were to leave their work sites by the end of May 2022, which placed the borrowing institution (Arctic LNG 2 LLC) and its contractors in a race against time to procure essential equipment and technology before deliveries to Russia became much harder or impossible. However, in January 2023, Novatek ordered Chinese yards to restart work on LNG modules destined for the Arctic LNG 2 Project, after an eight-month hiatus in activities related European sanctions on Russia.   There are also indications that the Arctic LNG 2 Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from \\u2018unfriendly states\\u2019\\u2014including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine\\u2014in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination.  Then, in June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.  Two months earlier, in April 2022, France\\u2019s Total, announced a $4.1 billion impairment and Japan's Mitsui & Co, Ltd. decided to take a write-off related to its 10 percent equity stake in the Arctic LNG 2 Project. Mitsui & Co, Ltd. reported that it had recorded a loss of $162 million related to its investment in project as a result of higher loan and guarantee obligations stemming from a worsening Russian credit rating. The fact that at least two of Arctic LNG 2 LLC's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 also complicated the implementation of the project.\",\"On September 17, 2007, a consortium consisting of China Eximbank, China Railways Construction Company (CREC), and Sinohydro and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a \\u201cprotocol d\\u2019accord\\u201d (or \\u201c\\u9879\\u76ee\\u6362\\u8d44\\u6e90\\u534f\\u8bae\\u201d). According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68 percent stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino\\u2013Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale des Carri\\u00e8res et des Mine SARL (G\\u00e9camines SARL) would own the other 32 percent. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the \\u201cprotocol d\\u2019accord\\u201d. Then, on April 22, 2008, a \\u201cconvention de collaboration\\u201d (Chinese name: \\u5173\\u4e8e\\u521a\\u679c\\u6c11\\u4e3b\\u5171\\u548c\\u56fd\\u77ff\\u4e1a\\u5f00\\u53d1\\u548c\\u57fa\\u7840\\u8bbe\\u65bd\\u5efa\\u8bbe\\u7684\\u5408\\u4f5c\\u534f\\u8bae) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing\\u2014reportedly worth $3 billion each\\u2014would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). Principal repayments were not scheduled to commence until 2018, which implies a grace period of 10 years. The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects. The April 2008 agreement specified that ownership of the Sicomines joint venture was allocated such that CREC holds 43% ownership of the joint venture, Sinohydro holds 25%, G\\u00e9camines holds 20%, and a Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) holds 12%.   On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which change the ownership allocation to CREC: 28%, Sinohydro: 20%, China Metallurgical Group Corporation: 20%, G\\u00e9camines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership allocation to CREC: 33%, Sinohydro: 30%, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt: 5%, G\\u00e9camines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. Project ID#450 provides a list of the infrastructure projects and subsidiary loans that have been approved to date. Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 \\u201cconvention de collaboration,\\u201d it was reported that the Chinese company consortium were to provide $2.9 billion in loans to cover (1) a $32 million loan to G\\u00e9camines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was $100 million); (2) $50 million loan to G\\u00e9camines to procure supplies; and (3) to provide a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi. The $2.9 billion was ultimately provided through a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (pr\\u00eat d\\u2019actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity, a $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to G\\u00e9camines, and a $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to G\\u00e9camines. Project ID#73204 captures the interest-free shareholder loan from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. Project ID#73145 captures the loan from China Eximbank. The $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to G\\u00e9camines is captured via Project ID#91873.  The $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to G\\u00e9camines is captured via Project ID#91875. At the end of Fiscal Year 2013, Sino\\u2013Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL) disclosed that it had received loan disbursements worth $423,889,454. However, it did not disclose if these disbursements came from the China Eximbank loan, the interest-free shareholder loan (pr\\u00eat d\\u2019actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) and Sinohydro Corporation, both loans, or other loans/sources. The Congolese government agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the \\u2018infrastructure loan\\u2019 and the \\u2018mining loan\\u2019 from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms.   However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 \\u00e0 la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d\\u2019un Projet Minier et d\\u2019un Projet d\\u2019Infrastructures en R\\u00e9publique D\\u00e9mocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the \\u201cconvention de collaboration\\u201d in October 2009. It reduced size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3,003,830,000 and removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank (captured via Project ID#73145). The sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan was left in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 \\u201cconvention de collaboration\\u201d, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over G\\u00e9camines\\u2019 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium\\u2019s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and the Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi.  Construction of the copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi began in April 2013, and on November 6, 2015 the first phase of the mining project was completed. The first phase of the mining project achieved full-capacity production and became profitable in April 2016. The second phase commenced at some point between August 2019 and May 21, 2020. Upon completion of the project\\u2019s second phase, the mine\\u2019s annual copper output is expected to reach 250,000 metric tons (if it runs at full capacity).

As of 2020, the total estimated amount outstanding under the $3,003,830,000 China Eximbank infrastructure loan was $1,179,507,661.83.\",\"According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), on September 18, 2013, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $5 billion credit facility agreement with Banco de Desarrollo Econ\\u00f3mico y Social de Venezuela (BANDES) and Petr\\u00f3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) for unspecified purposes. The borrowing terms are unknown. This loan was collateralized with PDVSA income from oil sales.\",\"On June 21, 2013, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Rosneft \\u2014 a Russian state-owned oil company \\u2014 signed a $270 billion oil supply contract to increase oil deliveries to China under the condition of advance payment. The contract went into effect in late December 2013 after it was ratified by Russian law (Federal Law #352-FZ), passed by the Russian State Duma on December 10, 2013, approved by the country's Federal Council on December 18, 2013, and signed by the President of Russian Federation on December 20, 2013. Under the terms of the contract, Rosneft agreed to increase its supply of oil to China through the Russia-China Crude Pipeline (Eastern Route) by approximately 360 million tons \\u2014 from 15 million tons per year in 2013 to 30 million tons per year by 2018. The term of the oil supply contract was 25 years, with the option of a 5-year extension. According to the terms of the contract, CNPC agreed to pay $60-70 billion in advance to Rosneft. Rosneft, in turn, agreed to repay CNPC at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 229 basis points. The $60-70 billion advance payment was scheduled to disburse in five tranches.   Multiple sources confirm that the first three tranches \\u2014 worth approximately $33 billion \\u2014 disbursed between 2013 and 2015. However, since it is unclear if the fourth or fifth tranches ever disbursed, AidData records the transaction amount as $33 billion for the time being. It is also unclear how the borrower used the proceeds of the loan, but at the time that the CNPC-Rosneft oil prepayment contract was announced in 2013, JP Morgan analysts told Reuters that \\u2018if confirmed, this would be a transformational event for the company's balance sheet: Rosneft could even potentially be able to show a net cash position, though working capital would be negative. The prepayment could minimize financing risks for the leveraged state-controlled oil company.\"],\"shape\":[307],\"dtype\":\"object\",\"order\":\"little\"}],[\"Status\",{\"type\":\"ndarray\",\"array\":[\"Implementation\",\"Implementation\",\"Implementation\",\"Pipeline:

The proceeds from the four China Eximbank BCLs were used to pay China Metallurgical Group Corporation for its work on the A1, A2, A3, and A4 Sections of the CKE. The project commenced on August 18, 2009. It was completed and the CKE was opened for public use on October 27, 2013.   The CKE links the Sri Lankan capital Colombo with Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake and Negombo. The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake. The speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for the first eight kilometers (5.0 mi) and 100 km/h (62 mph) for the rest of the road. The CKE has 42 bridges and 88 culverts including a 480-meter long viaduct at Hunupitiya and an 800-meter viaduct at Katunayake. The opening of the expressway has allowed people to travel between Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka and Katunayake, the major international airport of Sri Lanka, within 15 minutes.   However, the CKE project has also encountered debt repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.\",\"On February 18, 2011, China Eximbank signed an RMB 539,047,379 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST) Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 20 year maturity (final maturity date:  March 21, 2031), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: September 21, 2016), and a 2% interest rate.   The loan's principal amount outstanding was RMB 341,396,673.36 as of June 2023. As of 2022, the borrower expected to make principal repayments each year worth RMB 35,936,491 until 2031.  The project involved the construction of the Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST) in the district of Thyolo. The university was designed to accommodate 3,000 students.   The contractor responsible for project implementation was Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group Co., Ltd. (AFECC). Project implementation began on April 9, 2011. The project was scheduled for completion in time for the 2013/14 academic year and the official project handover ceremony took place on December 13, 2013.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST) Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2021, Malawi's Minister of Finance announced that \\u2018in 2020/21 FY, Government [of Malawi] requested temporary debt service suspension from bilateral creditors. This is in line with the Extended Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). The key feature of the Extended DSSI is that the repayment period of the principal and interest payments falling due between 1st January 2021 to 30th June 2021 will be made in five years with one-year grace period. This entails that in 2021/22 FY, the suspended debt service will be within the grace period.\\u2019 Then, in November 2022, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of Malawi\\u2019s external\\u00a0debt and overall public\\u00a0debt\\u00a0to be \\u2018in\\u00a0distress\\u2019\\u2014a downgrade from the previous\\u00a0World Bank-IMF Debt\\u00a0Sustainability Analysis (DSA). In July 2023 correspondence with AidData\\u2019s Executive Director, the Government of Malawi revealed that it was in negotiations with China Eximbank about rescheduling all of their loans with amounts outstanding. The Government of Malawi proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 50 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 90 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 89 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 88 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 87 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 86 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 85 million in principal and interest payments in 2032. China Eximbank proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 148 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 299 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 294 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 228 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 121 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 101 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 82 million in principal and interest payments in 2032. As of July 2023, a debt rescheduling deal had not yet been reached by the parties. \",\"On September 17, 2012, China Eximbank and Sri Lanka\\u2019s Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) signed a $88.66 million buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [No. BLA-201207] for the Colombo Lotus Tower Project. The BCL, which is captured via Project ID#33380, carries the following terms: a 12 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, a 0.7% commitment fee, a 0.9% management fee, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4% margin. The loan\\u2019s final maturity date is July 21, 2024. The total cost of the Colombo Lotus Tower Project was $104.3 million and proceeds of the BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the project cost. The Government of Sri Lanka issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the BCL. The loan\\u2019s outstanding amount was $49.53 million as of December 31, 2018, $40.66 million os of December 31, 2019, $31.79 million as of December 31, 2020, and $22.93 million as of December 31, 2021.   The purpose of the project was to establish a multipurpose television and telecommunication tower with a leisure park in Colombo. It involved the construction of a 350 meter high multifunctional telecommunication tower with a floor area that includes radio and TV transmission, restaurants, hotels, conference & exhibition facilities, and a leisure park. Upon completion, the Colombo Lotus Tower or ('Nelum Kuluna') was expected to be South Asia's tallest tower. Lotus Tower's main revenue sources were expected to be tourism and antenna leasing. It was expected to function as a radio and television broadcasting antenna ISDB-T and proposed DVB-T2 support structure for 50 television services, 35 FM radio stations, and and 20 telecommunication service providers. It was also expected to house a variety of tourist attractions.   A Chinese consortium \\u2014 consisting of China National Electronics Import and Export Corporation (CEIEC) and Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co.Ltd. (ALIT) \\u2014 initially agreed to jointly implement the project on a turnkey basis. However, ALIT left the consortium in August 2015, entrusting its partner CEIEC to act solely on its behalf to fulfill the contract with the TRC. Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd was also involved in implementation.   A foundation stone laying ceremony took place on January 20, 2012. Construction began on November 12, 2012. The originally anticipated project completion date was October 31, 2017 but it was later pushed back to December 31, 2018. An official opening and fireworks ceremony for the Lotus Tower took place on September 16, 2019. However, the \\u2018first stage\\u2019 of the tower was not even partially opened for use until September 15, 2022 when the observation deck and a few areas in the tower were opened. The second stage of the tower (which includes e-sports centers and a digital museum) was scheduled for opening in November 2022 and the third stage of the tower (which includes a 9D cinema and a revolving restaurant) was scheduled for opening in March 2023. The Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka claims that the project created jobs for more than 1000 local workers. However, the project was plagued by implementation delays, financial mismanagement allegations, and debt repayment challenges. Sri Lanka's Ports and Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga claimed that construction was taking place on land that belongs to the Ports Authority without proper government approval. Also, President Maithripala Sirisena alleged in 2019 that ALIT misappropriated 2 billion rupees (approximately $11 million) in a deal to work on the construction of South Asia's tallest tower.   Then, in 2020, China Eximbank and TRC signed a debt rescheduling agreement (captured via Project ID#96152) that extended the loan\\u2019s maturity date by two years: from July 21, 2024 to July 31, 2026. In July 2022, the Financial Times reported that the tower \\u201cwas designed to look like a giant lotus bud about to burst into flower, [and] it was intended to be a metaphor for the flourishing of Sri Lanka\\u2019s economy and the 'brilliant future' of the bilateral co-operation between Beijing and Colombo. Instead, the tower has become a symbol of the mounting problems facing China\\u2019s overseas lending scheme, the \\u2018Belt and Road Initiative.' The construction suffered from lengthy delays and an allegation of corruption [leveled] by Sri Lanka\\u2019s then-president Maithripala Sirisena against one of the Chinese contractors.   Now, three years after its official launch, the tower\\u2019s amenities including a shopping mall, a conference center, and several restaurants stand either unfinished or largely unused while outside on the streets outrage over Sri Lanka\\u2019s financial mismanagement has boiled over into popular protests. \\u2018It is something we would have done better without,\\u2019 says Athula Kumarasiri, a bookshop owner, as he motions towards the tower. \\u2018What is the need for this? It is a complete white elephant.' In September 2022, Colombo Lotus Tower Management Company said that the delayed opening of the tower would lead to significant financial losses. \\u2018We can\\u2019t keep this closed. The maintenance costs are huge,\\u2019 Chief Administrative Officer Prasad Samarasinghe told reporters.\",\"On September 9, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $75.4 million buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [No.BLA 201004] for the Northern Road Rehabilitation Project (C3 and C7). The face value of the BCL was subsequently downsized to $74,758,205. The BCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 6-month LIBOR plus a 2% margin, a 15-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, a 0.5% management fee, a 0.7% commitment fee, and a 6% Sinosure insurance premium (exposure fee).

C3 stands for Contract 3. C7 stands for Contract 7.   China Railway No.5 Engineering Group was the contractor responsible for implementation of C7. China Harbour Engineering Corporation was the contractor responsible for implementation of C3. The preliminary activities of the project commenced on December 1, 2010. Project completion was originally scheduled for December 8, 2013.

The agreement was signed by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul Toungui and China's ambassador Hxue Jinwei. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 3% interest rate.  Also, on May 24, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Gabon also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement worth $300 million for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance approximately $370 million of a $398 million Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro. The Government of Gabon covered the remaining $28 million cost of the EPC contract.  The Government of Gabon also issued sovereign guarantees for the two loans from China Eximbank.  Project ID#85 captures the GCL, while Project ID#73173 captures the PBC.   The project involved the construction of a dam on the Ogoou\\u00e9 river with 4 Francis turbines capable of generating 160 MW. The dam was built in part to generate power for an iron ore mine in Belinga (see Project ID#630).  The project also involved the construction of two power transmission lines: a 15 km line from the dam site to Franceville, the country's third largest city, and another line from the dam site to Moanda (the largest manganese mining region in Gabon and in the world).  The dam is located 15 km outside of Franceville in the province of Haut-Ogoou\\u00e9, more than 700 km southwest of Libreville, an area where the Compagnie mini\\u00e8re de l\\u2019Ogoou\\u00e9\\u2019s (COMILOG) main manganese mine is located.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction officially began on November 15, 2008, and it was originally anticipated that the construction process will be completed in 54 months (May 15, 2013).   The dam was impounded on April 30, 2013.  Then, the four power generating units went into operation on August 5, 2013. The dam, water diversion system and other civil works passed final inspection by the project owner on July 22, 2014. The power generator set and auxiliary equipment also passed final inspection by the project owner on August 9, 2014, effectively marking the completion of the project.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon\\u2019s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country\\u2019s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon\\u2019s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, \\u2018the stock of [the Government of] Gabon\\u2019s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-\\u00e0-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-\\u00e0-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-\\u00e0-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-\\u00e0-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-\\u00e0-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).\\u2019 Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon\\u2019s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022. \",\"On March 23, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $188,300,000 loan agreement for the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project and the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project.

According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP,  China Eximbank made 8 loan disbursements (worth ETB 1,430,840,952) between 2012 and 2016 for the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project: an ETB 306,242,215 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 314,011,517 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 426,716,141 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 136,837,684 disbursement on July 7, 2013,  an ETB 132,196,970 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 104,597,701 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 2,047,745 disbursement on July 7, 2015, and an ETB 8,190,980 disbursement on January 7, 2016.   The purpose of the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project was to evacuate power from the ICBC-financed 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III hydroelectric dam (captured via Project ID#34447) to the capital city of Addis Ababa. It was designed and implemented in two \\u2018lots\\u2019. One of the lots involved the construction of a 293 km transmission line from Wolayta Sodo (also known as Sodo) to Sebeta via Akaki. The other lot involved the construction of a 50.3 km and 51 km double circuit transmission line from the Gibe III hydroelectric dam to the Wolayta Sodo distribution station. The Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project involved the construction two new 400kv electricity distribution substations in Wolayta Sodo (Welata Sodo) and Akaki, and the expansion of an existing electricity distribution substations in Sebeta.   TBEA Co. Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project. Shanghai Electric Group and Sinohydro were the EPC contractors responsible for the implementation of the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project.   These projects were originally scheduled for completion by April 2013. However, they were ultimately completed in December 2015 and officially inaugurated on September 14, 2016. This project reportedly brought increased power to the southern part of the country\\u2019s electricity grid and reduced local power shortages.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On December 23, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $259 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO.

The other borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The GCL carries a 2% interest rate. The other borrowing terms of the GCL are unknown.  The proceeds of the PBC and the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Pakistan's National Highway Authority (NHA) and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on December 21, 2010.   The project had a total length of 24 kilometers and involved the realignment of a portion of the highway that was submerged under water during the Attabad landslide in 2010.  It involved the realignment of roads, construction of 5 tunnels with total length of 7.12 km, 78 culverts and 2 bridges (471.8 meters).   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 26, 2012 and the project was completed on September 14, 2015.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) Realignment Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the government concessional loan agreement for Phase 1 of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) Realignment Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-030].

Then, on December 16, 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $58,228,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Tajikistan for the 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project. The loan  carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2%.   The Government of Tajikistan used nearly all of the proceeds from the loan ($55,227,590) to on-lend (through subsidiary loan agreement No. BLA06016) to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d -- a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy -- at a 3% interest rate between December 16, 2006 and June 21, 2026. OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 95% of the cost of a $58.1 million commercial contract with TBEA Co., Ltd. The Government of Tajikistan was expected to provide the remaining 5% ($2.9 million).  The loan's amount outstanding was TJS 434,984,000 as of December 31, 2016,  TJS 487,052,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 520,774,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 535,001,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 624,072,000 as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 90 km, 220 kV electricity transmission line between Dangara and Kulab. This would connect the southern region to the national grid. The new power transmission line would improve the power supply in the south of the Khatlon region, and create a more stable power supply. The Lolazor-Khatlon line had a capacity of approximately 4 billion kWh of electricity a year. The project was to provide the Khatlon region with electricity from the Sangtuda 1 and 2 hydroelectric power plants, and allow for the export of electricity to Afghanistan.   TBEA Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project was launched in May 2006. The transmission line was planned to be commissioned by the end of December 2007, but the inclusion of the construction of an additional internal 110 kV transmission line from the Khatlon substation to the Bokhtar substation postponed the start date. The Lolazor-Khatlon transmission line was commissioned on June 25, 2008.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $37,640,315) took place on December 31, 2009; the second loan disbursement (of $33,876,284) took place on December 31, 2010; and the third loan disbursement (of $3,764,100) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that, as of 2015, the loan disbursement rate was 99.9% and total loan disbursements amounted to $75,280,699. According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, the loan achieved a disbursement rate of 99.9% ($75,280,630.85 of $75,290,000) as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $38,022,416 as of December 31, 2021.

Upon completion, the project was expected to connect the Kyrgyz Republic with the People\\u2019s Republic of China, reduce travel times, and increase trade volumes and economic transactions.  China Road and Bridge Corporation was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in 2008 and the road was officially opened for use on November 22, 2012. However, the project as a whole did not achieve completion until December 20, 2013. An ADB impact evaluation of the project in August 2019 that it 'had a positive effect on poverty reduction and retail trade growth.'  However, there are some indications that the preferential buyer's credit for the Osh-Sarytash-Irkeshtam Road Rehabilitation Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029]. Under the terms of the agreement (captured via Project ID#96102), the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for the Osh-Sarytash-Irkeshtam Road Rehabilitation Project.\",\"On April 5, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Myanmar signed a $101.98 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Upper Yeywa-Shwesaryan 230 kV Transmission Line and 230 kV Shwesaryan Substation Extension Project. The signing of the loan agreement marked the completion of the financing of the project and a major breakthrough in the progress of the project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 90% of the cost of a commercial contract with Hydrochina Corporation (\\u4e2d\\u56fd\\u6c34\\u7535\\u5de5\\u7a0b\\u987e\\u95ee\\u96c6\\u56e2), which was signed on March 1, 2012.  Hydrochina Corporation (\\u4e2d\\u56fd\\u6c34\\u7535\\u5de5\\u7a0b\\u987e\\u95ee\\u96c6\\u56e2) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PowerChina.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 129 km, 230 kV power transmission line from a to-be-constructed 280MW (4x70MW) Upper Yeywa Hydropower Plant (exact locational coordinates: 22.2413452801704, 97.10127992329045) to the Shwesaryan (Shwe Sar Yan) substation (exact locational coordinates: 21.85798, 96.23105) in Patheingyi Township. As of 2017, this project had achieved a 28% completion rate. However, AidData has not identified any evidence that it reached completion.   Implementation delays are likely related to the fact that the 280MW (4x70MW) Upper Yeywa Hydropower Plant was still not complete as of Q2 of 2021 and its construction has triggered various protests. Shan civil society groups have opposed the building of the Upper Yeywa Hydropower Plant. They claim that the project, which was started by the military regime in 2008, was initiated without local consultation or consent and that the reservoir of the 280 megawatt dam will stretch for 60 kilometers up to Hsipaw town, submerging centuries-old Shan communities and fertile farmlands. The dam site also lies in an active conflict zone, and Burma Army troops guarding the site have allegedly committed gross human rights violations against local villagers, including extrajudicial killing, torture and use of human shields. On February 17, 2021, workers from the Upper Yeywa dam site joined protests in Kyaukme, holding a banner that said \\u2018Upper Yeywa Hydropower Project Civil Disobedience Movement.\\u2019   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Upper Yeywa-Shwesaryan 230 kV Transmission Line and 230 kV Shwesaryan Substation Extension Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 3 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreements, 6 government concessional loan (GCL) agreements, and 27 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreements (as captured via Project ID#98029).  Debt service payments under many of these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#96221).\",\"On June 23, 2015, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ltd (ICBC) and Exmar \\u2014 a Belgian shipping company that specializes in liquefied gas logistics and storage \\u2014 signed a $198 million export buyer\\u2019s credit agreement for the Caribbean Floating LNG (CFLNG) Project (captured via Project ID#88165). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   The purpose of the project was to build and acquire the world's first floating LNG (FLNG) storage facility. The contractors responsible for the construction of this floating LNG storage facility were Wison (Nantong) Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. and Wison Offshore Engineering Co., Ltd. The FLNG ordered by EXMAR was to be the world\\u2019s first floating natural gas liquefaction unit. It was expected to have the functions of natural gas processing, liquefaction and storage, and represents the new generation of offshore units. The unit, which was 95% complete as of March 2015, was originally expected to serve as the gas project of Pacific Rubiales Energy, which is the second biggest oil and gas company of Colombia.  However, in March 2016, Exmar and Pacific Exploration & Production (PEP) agreed to terminate a 15-year tolling agreement (liquefaction and storage agreement) because PEP was facing a possible Chapter 11 filing (bankruptcy). Miguel de Potter, Exmar\\u2019s CFO, told a media outlet that the contract termination would limit his company\\u2019s exposure to a possible bankruptcy filing by PEP. 'Looking at the latest press releases, we have a fair chance to see that they will default on their [loan] covenant and will sometime end up in a Chapter 11 situation. By terminating the contract, we can open up the vessel to other opportunities,' Potter said. In March 2016, Exmar put out a press release, which said that '[s]ince the execution of the tolling agreement, the domestic natural gas market in Colombia and international LNG market have changed substantially making the liquefaction of LNG in Colombia no longer economic for PEP.' During 2016, the export buyer\\u2019s credit agreement with ICBC was also cancelled.  Then, on July 27, 2017, Exmar announced that it had taken delivery of the CFLNG from Wison Offshore & Marine in the People\\u2019s Republic of China. The CFLNG consists of a 500,000 tons per year floating liquefaction plant with 16,000 m3 of LNG storage and will remain moored in Wison Shipyard. Then, in August 2018, Exmar agreed to deploy CFLNG as a pilot production system for LNG export in Bah\\u00eda Blanca, Argentina. A contract was signed by Exmar and the Argentinian Oil and Gas Company (YPF S.A.) on November 20, 2018 and the Caribbean FLNG became the Tango FLNG. Site specific modification and reactivation works were carried out in China, where the Tango FLNG unit was laid up. It was loaded onto a semi-submersible heavy lift vessel (HLV) close to Shanghai in December 2018. In parallel, gas treatment and compression equipment was sourced and procured, and modifications to the jetty were completed. The unit arrived in Bah\\u00eda Blanca in February 2019. After mooring up, commissioning activities were started, ultimately resulting in the successful delivery of a first LNG cargo on June 6, 2019.  Shortly after the cancellation of the ICBC agreement, Exmar entered into negotiations with Bank of China (BoC). Following the signature of a term sheet in November 2016 with BoC and the approval of terms by the latter\\u2019s credit committees in December 2016 and January 2017, Exmar finalized the documentation required to enable parties to sign the credit agreement. The final credit agreement with BoC was subject to the approval of the credit insurer, Sinosure. Exmar originally expected this approval to be available by mid-April 2017. Ultimately, at the end of June 2017, EXPORT Lng Limited -- a 100% subsidiary of EXMAR NV -- signed a $200 million loan agreement with Bank of China (Boc) and Deutsche Bank for the financing of the TANGO FLNG (captured via Project ID#88167). This loan, which was insured by Sinosure, was fully disbursed (drawn down) as of July 27, 2017. The agreement with BoC provides a repayment period of 12 years and the loan bears interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The yearly estimated debt service amounts to $21.3 million. All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed by EXMAR NV (\\u201cguarantor\\u201d). There is a requirement for the owner to deposit an amount of $66 million in an escrow account (debt service reserve account).  On February 26, 2020, Bank of China released $40 million from the debt service reserve account. The relaxation of the cash collateral followed the steady operational results of the TANGO FLNG since September 2019, under the 10-years\\u2019 charter with YPF S.A. The $40 million was partially allocated to the repayment of the bridge loans and to cover Exmar's capital commitments. TANGO FLNG was performing 20% above its designed capacity in Argentina until May 2020. Since its arrival in 2019 at the Bahia Blanca terminal in Argentina up to May 2020, TANGO FLNG delivered five shipments or 624,000 m\\u00b3 of LNG to its customer (YPF S.A.) with an availability of 99%.  However, the Argentinian Oil and Gas Company (YPF S.A.) invoked an alleged force majeure during the COVID-19 crisis, stopping all payments to Exmar. The dispute was referred to arbitration and ultimately YPF S.A. and Exmar came to a settlement whereby the 10-year contract for the TANGO FLNG was terminated. YPF S.A. is responsible for paying Exmar a cancellation fee worth $150 million payable over a period of 18 months, with payments secured. The balance of the settlement amount is payable by YPF S.A. in 13 monthly installments backed by a financial security issued by an investment grade counterparty.  Meanwhile, the TANGO FLNG unit has been demobilized from Argentina and stationed in a sheltered location in Uruguay. Since the effective termination of the contract with YPF S.A. in October 2020, marketing is in full swing and, given its status as a fully-proven facility, there is a healthy interest from the market for the redeployment of TANGO FLNG. The fact that the start of 2021 saw increased price levels of oil and gas globally will reportedly benefit the opportunities for reactivation.\",\"On December 3, 2015, during the state visit of Gabonese President Ali Bongo Ondimba to China, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank signed a buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement worth $102,849,176.27 for the 22 km Farasol Mb\\u00e9ga-Port-Gentil Road Project. The BCL carries the following terms: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.2% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.5% ($514,245.88) management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee.  The proceeds from the BCL will be used to finance 95% of the cost of a commercial contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). The Government of Gabon was expected to cover the remaining 5% of the cost of the commercial contract.   The project involved the construction of a 22km road segment from Farasol-Mb\\u00e9ga to Port-Gentil. This road segment connects to the starting point of the China Eximbank-financed Port Gentil-Ombou\\u00e9 (PO) Road (captured via Project ID#60747 and Project ID#73174).   CRBC was the contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 28, 2016. The project was reportedly completed; however, its precise completion date is unknown.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 22 km Farasol Mb\\u00e9ga-Port-Gentil Road Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon\\u2019s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country\\u2019s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon\\u2019s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, \\u2018the stock of [the Government of] Gabon\\u2019s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-\\u00e0-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-\\u00e0-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-\\u00e0-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-\\u00e0-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-\\u00e0-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).\\u2019 There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Kpong Water Expansion Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the World Bank\\u2019s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Then, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.\",\"In September 2014, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed in principle to provide a $400 million loan to Sri Lanka\\u2019s National Water Supply and Drainage Board for the implementation of the following water supply projects: Katana Water Supply Project; Thambuttegama Water Supply Project; and Kandy North Water Supply Project. A proposal made by Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, to proceed with the relevant activities pertaining to the loan arrangements, was approved by Sri Lanka\\u2019s Cabinet in September 2014. Then, on August 21, 2017, China Development Bank and Sri Lanka\\u2019s National Water Supply & Drainage Board signed a $102.5 million loan agreement [ID#4510201701100001265] for the Thambuttegama Water Supply Project (WSP). This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 15.5-year maturity and an all-in interest rate of approximately 2.954%. The loan\\u2019s final maturity date is March 6, 2033, and the Government of Sri Lanka issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the China Development Bank loan to partially finance a $120.5 million commercial contract between Sri Lanka\\u2019s National Water Supply and Drainage Board and China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (AVIC), which was signed in July 2015. The remaining $18 million was to be provided by the Bank of Ceylon, a state-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka.   The purpose of the project is to provide safe drinking water via pipes to all 45 Grama Niladdhari divisions in Katana Divisional Secretariat covering 50% of the population in the area (similar to the CDB-financed Katana Water Supply Project captured via Project ID#53566). It involves the construction of a water intake structure with a capacity of 42,000 m3/day, a water treatment plant of 18,000m3/day, a ground reservoir of 1,500 m3 capacity, raw water and treated water transmission mains totaling up to an approximate length of 50 km, elevated towers of 1,500 m3 capacity, a distribution network of 135 km, and facilities to operate and maintain the water supply scheme.   CATIC China Geo Eng JV \\u2014 a joint venture of China Geo-Engineering Corporation (CGC) and China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (AVIC) \\u2014 is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. The project commenced in July 2018. As of September 30, 2018, it had achieved a \\u2018physical progress\\u2019 rate of 4%. As of early 2021, it had achieved a \\u2018physical progress\\u2019 rate of 61.2%. As of June 30, 2022, it had achieved a \\u2018physical progress\\u2019 rate of 85.23%. The project was originally expected to reach completion in June 2022. However, it encountered problems and delays during implementation. In March 2022, By early 2022, it was clear that the loan was non-performing and China Development Bank suspended loan disbursements. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Development Bank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement. As of March 2023, the Government of Sri Lanka had accumulated $338 million in arrears to China Development Bank.\",\"On September 21, 2012, China Eximbank and the Government of Fiji\\u2019s Ministry of Economy signed an RMB 642,417,124 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Nabouwalu-Dreketi Road Upgrading Project. The GCL carries the a 2% interest rate, a maturity of 20.25 years (final maturity date: December 6, 2032), and an unknown grace period. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with China Railway First Group (Fiji) Company Ltd.  The loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding was RMB 1515,449,391.95 (FJD 160,761,435.91) as of June 30, 2023. The borrower made principal payments worth RMB 51,544,938 (FJD 16,747,649.01) and interest payments worth RMB 11,238,228.53 (FJD 3,651,264.24) between July 1, 2022 and June 30, 2023.   The purpose of the project was to upgrade a 70 km highway that runs from Labasa (Dreketi) to Nabouwalu (Nabouwalu jetty). The project also involved the construction of 14 new bridges and 209 culverts along the highway.   China Railway First Group (Fiji) Company Ltd. was the contractor responsible for implementation. The project was officially launched on March 15, 2013 and completed on July 28, 2015. At its peak, the project employed 500 local workers. The Nabouwalu-Dreketi Road was opened for public use on January 11, 2016. This project reportedly reduced travel time between Nabouwalu jetty to Labasa from 7 hours to 2 hours.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Nabouwalu-Dreketi Road Upgrading Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Fiji signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under multiple government concessional loan (GCL) agreements (as captured via Project ID#95365).  Debt service payments under all or many of these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#95363).\",\"On November 15, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Mozambique signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 656,000,000 for the Beira-Machipanda (N6) Road Rehabilitation Project. This GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 21 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and and 1% interest rate. Then, on January 13, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Mozambique signed a preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement worth $312,400,000 for the Beira-Machipanda (N6) Road Rehabilitation Project. This PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. Project ID#31066 captures the GCL and Project ID#57336 captures the PBC. The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group Co., Ltd. (AFECC) and Mozambique's National Roads Administration, which was signed on March 27, 2012.   The $416.5 million project involved the upgrading and rehabilitation of an 288 km road from Beira to Machipanda and a bridge that was constructed over the River Pungue. The completion of the project was expected to shorten the journey from the western border of Mozambique to the port of Beira from 7 hours to 4 hours, thereby facilitating regional connectivity, stimulating the development of agriculture, tourism and other industries along the route, and promoting exports.   AFECC was the contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 10, 2014. However, construction did not begin until April 1, 2015. The project was originally scheduled for completion on March 31, 2018. However, it was ultimately completed and National Highway No. 6 was opened to traffic on November 14, 2019. The collection of tolls commenced on January 1, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Beira-Machipanda (N6) Road Rehabilitation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique\\u2019s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283).\",\"On August 16, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 634 million ($95,680,000 or ETB 1,718,140,345) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [No. 1420303052011111536] for Phase 3 of the Addis Ababa Deep Wells Water Supply Project. The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the agreement on December 5, 2011. The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 2% interest rate, an 8-year grace period, and a 21-year maturity.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the loan achieved a 174% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 7 loan disbursements (worth ETB 2,988,235,879) between 2013 and 2015: an ETB 548,151,920 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 366,666,667 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 366,666,667 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 314,960,630 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 540,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 606,060,606 disbursement on January 8, 2015, and an ETB 245,729,390  disbursement on July 7, 2015.   The purpose of the project was to drill 24 water wells -- including three deep water wells in the Akaki well field areas -- and produce about 10,000 cubic meters of water per a day, thereby benefiting 100,000 people. The project also included 266.3 km of main line installation, 10.5 km distribution line installation, and 25.8 km of collection lines. It also included construction of six water tankers that have the capacity of holding from 1,000 cubic meters of water to 5,000 cubic meters of water. The Akaki well field is located to the southeast of Akaki town about 22 km south of the center of Addis Ababa within the Akaki catchment.   CGC Overseas Construction Co. Ltd, (CGCOC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was supervised by a local company called Water Works Design and Supervision. Project implementation commenced on November 19, 2012. A project completion ceremony was held on March 8, 2015.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 3 of the Addis Ababa Deep Wells Water Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On October 4, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $102,736,147.53 (ETB 2,286,586,782) buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement [Contract No. BLAETH2016001] for the Qality Ring Road Interchange Tulu Dimtu Roundabout Road and Qality Ring Road Bulbula-Qilinto Roundabout Road Project. The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the loan under Proclamation No.988/2017 on December 27, 2016 and the proclamation went into effect on January 3. 2017. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 2.6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee.  The borrower is expected to use the loan proceeds to finance approximately 50% of the total cost of a ETB 4,168,889,036.14 commercial (EPC) contract between Addis Ababa Roads Authority (AACRA) and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). The remainder of the commercial contract cost is expected to be directly financed from the budget of City Administration of Addis Ababa.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $102,736,147.53  (ETB 2,286,586,782) loan achieved a 38% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single disbursement of ETB 861,595,457 on March 28, 2018.   The purpose of this project is support the construction of two subsidiary projects (\\u2018Lot 1\\u2019 and \\u2018Lot 2\\u2019). Lot 1 involves the construction of the 11 km Qality-Tulu Dimtu Ring Road Interchange (also known as the Kality Ring Road Interchange - Tulu Dimtu Roundabout and the Qality Ring Road Interchange-Tulu Dimtu Ring Road), which is located on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. Lot 1 also involves the construction of five bridges as well as the Akaki Bridge. Lot 2 involves the construction of the 10.6 km Qality Ring Road to Qilinto Road (also known as the Kality Ring Road - Kilinto Roundabout and Bole Bulbula project and the Qality ring road to Qilinto road project). Lot 2 will connect Bole Michael ring road and Qality ring road and thereby provide for easy transportation route for the goods from the Qilinto industrial zone. This road segment is also expected to be useful for the condominium residents in the area. Lot 2 also involves the construction of a 250 meter-span bridge as well as an underpass bridge. Since both road segments (Lots 1 and 2) are located in areas that are important for trade, they are expected to improve market access for small businesses and industrial parks.   IFH Engineering plc \\u2014 a wholly owned subsidiary of the CCCC \\u2014 is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and its work is being overseen by AACRA. ASER Construction also worked as a subcontractor for CCCC. Engineer Zewdie Eskinder and Company Plc. is responsible for providing consulting services for Lot 1. Hake Consultant Company is responsible for providing consulting services for Lot 2. A groundbreaking ceremony for Lot 1 and Lot 2 took place on February 14, 2017. As of April 2021, Lot 1 had achieved a 76% completion rate.   However, this project has faced local scrutiny and criticism due to the fact that it was reportedly among the most expensive road projects to ever be undertaken (in unit cost terms) in Ethiopia. Lot 1 costs ETB 222.7 million per kilometer of road and Lot 2 costs ETB 219.8 million per kilometer of road.  There are also indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Qality Ring Road Interchange Tulu Dimtu Roundabout Road and Qality Ring Road Bulbula-Qilinto Roundabout Road Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

In the event that the Luisha copper and cobalt deposit proves less profitable than expected, the assets acquired by G\\u00e9camines through the $60 million COVEC loan will also become sources of collateral.   As of December 2020, the loan had disbursed $60,196,008 and the borrower was in principal arrears (worth $24,078,405) and interest arrears (worth $32,901,385). The Luisha mine\\u2019s smelting system was constructed in two phases. The first phase of the hydrometallurgical system officially started construction in April 2012, and was put into operation in April 2013, producing standard cathode copper. The second phase of the project started construction in May 2013, and the flotation system began trial operations in June 2014. The civil construction of the roasting system and environmental protection acid production started in April 2014. These activities were completed in October 2015. The material was put into trial operation in late November 2015, and the trial production began in January 2016. On April 30, 2016, the mine officially entered the production stage. In July 2018, construction of the oxygen production station and the flue gas acid production started. In early May 2019, the docking of the old and new acid production systems and the renovation of the roaster were carried out. By early June 2019, all the docking renovation projects were completed.

It was designed and implemented in two \\u2018lots\\u2019. One of the lots involved the construction of a 293 km transmission line from Wolayta Sodo (also known as Sodo) to Sebeta via Akaki. The other lot involved the construction of a 50.3 km and 51 km double circuit transmission line from the Gibe III hydroelectric dam to the Wolayta Sodo distribution station. The Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project involved the construction two new 400kv electricity distribution substations in Wolayta Sodo (Welata Sodo) and Akaki, and the expansion of an existing electricity distribution substations in Sebeta.   TBEA Co. Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project. Shanghai Electric Group and Sinohydro were the EPC contractors responsible for the implementation of the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Substations Project.  These projects were originally scheduled for completion by April 2013. However, they were ultimately completed in December 2015 and officially inaugurated on September 14, 2016. This project reportedly brought increased power to the southern part of the country\\u2019s electricity grid and reduced local power shortages.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Gibe III-Addis Ababa Power Transmission Lines Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On June 15, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic's Ministry of Finance signed a RMB 697,562,608.76 ($112,640,000) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 9 TOTAL NO. 548] for the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km) of the Alternative North-South Road Project. The GCL (loan) carried the following borrowing terms: a 25 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, a 1.5% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.18% management fee, and a 0.18% commitment fee. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a May 4, 2014 commercial contract [EXMB/KG/NS-05] worth $298,796,966.13 between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).   According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 100% as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $702,910,588.76 as of December 31, 2021.    The purpose of the project was to construct a section of the Alternative North-South Road that runs from Aral to Kazarman (195 km to 291 km). The ultimate aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India.   CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on August 10, 2015 and the project was originally scheduled for completion in December 2018. However, as of December 2020, it had still only achieved a 70% completion rate. The project was ultimately completed on November 10, 2021. It passed China Eximbank's final inspection in November 2022.  There are some indications that the government concessional loan for the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km) of the Alternative North-South Road Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029]. Under the terms of the agreement (captured via Project ID#96102), the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the government concessional loan for the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km) of the Alternative North-South Road Project.  The Alternative North-South Road project has also been plagued by controversy and corruption allegations. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude \\u2014 from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.\",\"On September 17, 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Sri Lanka signed three loan agreements for Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP): a $51 million China Eximbank buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL), a $600 million China Eximbank preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2012 (42) Total No (230)], and an RMB 1 billion China Eximbank government concessional loan (GCL) [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. 2012 (22) TOTAL NO. (424)]. However, the face value of the GCL was eventually reduced to RMB 700,365,503. The BCL is captured via Project ID#39025. The PBC is captured via Project ID#39023. The GCL is captured via Project ID#39024.  The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of BCL, PBC, and GCL to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. It was originally envisaged that SLPA would use the proceeds of the BCL, PBC, and GCL to finance 100% of the cost of a $808,138,564.31 commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with CChina Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC) on December 31, 2010.  The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4% margin, a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, a 0.7% commitment fee, and a 0.9% management fee. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee.  The GCL disbursed RMB 381,500,000 between 2012 and 2016, unknown amounts between 2017 and 2018, and RMB 318,793,357.83 in 2019. The GCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was RMB 673,428,368 as of June 30, 2022. The PBC disbursed an unknown amount in 2012, an unknown amount in 2013, $147,249,692.27 in 2014, and $21,049,128.50 in 2015. As of December 31, 2019, it had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($600 million out of $600 million). The PBC\\u2019s amount outstanding was $600,000,000 as of December 31, 2016 and $484,615,385 as of June 30, 2022. The BCL was cancelled in 2019 and never disbursed.  Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area.   Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. CHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for HPDP Phase II implementation. Phase II was formally launched on November 18, 2010. However, construction did not begin until September 16, 2012, a day before the three loan agreements were signed.  Phase II was originally slated for completion in November 2015. A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. However, as of December 31, 2017, Phase II had still only achieved a 96% physical completion rate.  Phases I and II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) encountered financial management problems, debt repayment challenges, and corruption allegations. Hambantota Port generated lower-than-expected container traffic and proved to be commercially nonviable under SLPA ownership. Consequently, SLPA could not service its loans to China Eximbank. In response, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) \\u2014 a subsidiary of China Merchants Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) \\u2014 purchased a majority ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years.  More specifically, on July 29, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, and Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) signed a 99-year concession agreement and formed a joint venture to operate Hambantota Port. According to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CMPort acquired an 85% stake in Hambantota International Ports Group (HIPG) and a 49.3% stake in Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), representing about 70% of the total equity. CMPort was also granted the operating and management rights of HIPG and HIPS as well as the lease and development rights of approximately 11.5 square kilometers of land in the Hambantota port area. CMPort agreed to make a total equity investment of $1.12 billion, of which $974 million would be used to acquire the 85% stake in HIPG and $146 million would be deposited into a bank account in the name of CMPort in Sri Lanka (for the expansion of Hambantota Port and shipping-related business).  According to a July 20, 2017 Cabinet Memorandum entitled \\u2018Hambantota Port Concession Agreement\\u2019 (No. MPS/SEC/2017/32) that was approved by Sri Lanka\\u2019s Cabinet on August 4, 2017, when the concession agreement was signed, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans that were contracted for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred from SLPA to the General Treasury. Given that the General Treasury was also identified as the recipient of the $974 million cash infusion from CMPort, many media outlets and commentators reported that the arrangement represented a \\u2018debt-for-equity\\u2019 swap.  However, the Government of Sri Lanka continued to have difficulty servicing its debts to China Eximbank for Phases I and II of the HPDP after 2017. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. This decision to suspend external debt service affected all of the China Eximbank loans that were issued for Phases I and II of the HPDP.  Another source of controversy arose in June 2018 when the New York Times reported that $7.6 million had been transferred from a Standard Chartered Bank account controlled by China Harbor Engineering Co. (labelled \\u2018HPDP Phase 2\\u2019) to affiliates of President Rajapaksa\\u2019s re-election campaign. The New York Times also reported that checks worth $1.2 million (linked to the \\u2018HPDP Phase 2\\u2019 bank account) were delivered to President Rajapaksa\\u2019s official residence.\",\"On March 5, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 700 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [ID#1290003032010110253] for the Supply of 13 Diesel Multiple Units for Sri Lanka Railways Project. The face value of the GCL was subsequently downsized to RMB 644,443,837. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee. This first disbursement through this loan took place in 2010 and the last disbursement took place in 2014. China Eximbank disbursed RMB 201,269,677.71 (Rs. 3,386,040,296) in 2010, RMB 0 in 2011, RMB 177,586,994.32 (Rs. 3,678,278,808) in 2012, RMB 264,429,640.10 in 2013, and RMB 254,895,013.03 (Rs. 5,405,023,262) in 2014. The loan had achieved a 139.3% disbursement rate (RMB 898,181,325.16 out of RMB 644,443,837) as of December 31, 2014.   The borrower made repayments worth RMB 42,962,922 in 2018, RMB 42,962,922 in 2019, RMB 42,962,922 in 2020 and RMB 42,962,922 in 2021. The loan's amount outstanding was RMB 537,036,531 as of December 31, 2017, RMB 494,073,609 as of December 31, 2018, RMB 451,110,687 as of December 31, 2019, RMB 408,147,765 as of December 31, 2020, RMB 365,184,843 as of December 31, 2021, and RMB 343,703,380 as of June 30, 2022.   The loan that was issued for this project has encountered repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.   The purpose of the project was to facilitate the procurement of thirteen, Class S12 Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) for Sri Lanka Railways, and thereby strengthen the passenger transport service of Sri Lanka Railways by adding 13 DMUs to its fleet of rolling stock. Seven of the S12 DMUs were ordered to strengthen long-distance travel on the Main Line from Colombo to Badulla. The steep slopes on the up-country portion of the Main Line make it difficult to operate. Prior to the S12 DMUs, only a few models of locomotives were capable of operating this line. Four of the S12 DMUs were ordered to serve the Kelani Valley Line. Two of the S12 DMUs were ordered to be used for tourist transportation. The thirteen S12 DMUs were scheduled for delivery in four batch by September 2012. CRRC Sifang \\u2014 a wholly-owned subsidiary of China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry (Group) Corporation \\u2014 was the contractor responsible for delivery of the DMUs.  The first batch of DMUs arrived in Sri Lanka in August 2012. The first Main Line train using a S12 DMU began on October 23, 2012. This project is now complete, but the exact dates of delivery of the second, third, and fourth batches are unknown.   This project facilitated the acquisition of Diesel Multiple Units for use on the Main (Railway) Line from Colombo to Badulla and the Kelani Valley Line. The Main Line starts from Colombo and runs east and north past the rapidly developing centres of Ragama, Gampaha, Veyangoda, and Polgahawela. At Rambukkana, the Main Line begins its steep climb into the hills of the upcountry. Between Balana and Kadugannawa, the track clings to the side of sheer cliffs, offering passengers views of Batalegala ('Bible' Rock). From Peradeniya Junction, a branch line reaches Kandy and Matale. The Main Line then continues its climb through tea country, connecting local market centres at Gampola, Nawalapitiya, and Hatton before reaching Nanu Oya. The Main Line continues its ascent to the summit at Pattipola, 1,898 m (6,227 ft) above sea level, before descending past Bandarawela to Badulla. The Kelani Valley line runs southeast from Colombo Maradana Station, through much of the city of Colombo. It runs through major business centres, like Nugegoda and Maharagama, before turning eastwards. It crosses the Southern Expressway near Homagama and continues east towards Avissawella, the current terminus of the line. Major railway stations on the line are Colombo Fort, Maradana, Narahenpita, Nugegoda, Maharagama, Pannipitiya, Kottawa, Homagama, Meegoda, Padukka, Waga, Kosgama, and Avissawella.\",\"On September 10, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Mozambique signed a $119,976,000 loan agreement for the Beira Fishing Port Rehabilitation Project. Then, on November 15, 2014, the Government of Mozambique ratified this loan agreement. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 7 year grace period, and a 20 year maturity.   This project involved the construction of a dock that is 377 meters long (compared with 188 meters previously) in order to allow 16 industrial vessels to be moored simultaneously. It also involved the installation of six cold stores, an ice factory with a capacity of 60 tonnes per day, a fish processing room with a capacity of 50 tonnes per day, and a handling capacity of 700,000 tons per year. Beira\\u2019s fishing port was destroyed by cyclone Eline, which struck the provincial capital of Sofala in February 2000.   China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 27, 2016 and the project was officially completed and handed over to the authorities in Mozambique on October 28, 2019.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Beira Fishing Port Rehabilitation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique\\u2019s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283).\",\"The Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral & Research Hospital project was conceptualized in 2008. The Government of Kenya, through various line ministries, supported the idea developed by Kenyatta University Management led by the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof Olive Mugenda. The idea came to fruition with the signing of an MoU on April 21, 2011, between the Chinese and Kenyan governments.   Then, on June 17, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya\\u2019s National Treasury signed an RMB 744,560,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital Construction Project. The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 716,983,703.70. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20.75 year maturity, and a 7.25 year grace period. The loan was scheduled for semi-annual repayment installments beginning on September 21, 2018, and ending on March 21, 2032.    The National Treasury on-lent the proceeds of the GCL to Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral & Research Hospital (KUTRRH), which is a Kenyan state corporation. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the ultimate borrower to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Kenya and China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Co-operation (CJIC), which was signed on August 12, 2010.  The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 27,576,296 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 55,152,592.00 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).  The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was RMB 661,831,110.11 as of June 30, 2020, RMB 606,678,517.52 as of June 30, 2021, and RMB 551,525,924.93 as of June 30, 2022.  The project involved the construction of Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital (\\u80af\\u96c5\\u5854\\u5927\\u5b66\\u6559\\u5b66\\u8f6c\\u8bca\\u533b\\u9662) in Nairobi. The hospital covers an area of more than 600 acres with a total construction area over 80,000 square meters, has a total of more than 650 beds, 8 high-grade operating rooms, 1 maternal center, 1 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), 1 intensive care unit (ICU), 1 special intensive care unit (HDU), as well as medical imaging center, central supply room, oxygen, and medical gas system, boiler and laundry, medical waste treatment, funeral facilities, restaurant, teaching center, dormitory, and other supporting facilities. Construction of the 650-bed hospital involved the expansion and equipping of anatomy and basic science laboratories and the establishment of pre-clinical and clinical teaching departments at the university.    CJIC was the contractor responsible for implementation.  The project was originally scheduled to enter implementation in 2012 and reach completion by June 30, 2019. Construction commenced on November 1, 2012 and ended on December 14, 2016.   A formal project handover ceremony took place on May 24, 2019. However, the hospital did not open its doors to the first patient until October 28, 2019 after successfully conducting a \\u2018dry run\\u2019 from September 27, 2019 to October 27, 2019, followed by a successful 'soft run' from October 28, 2019 to November 24, 2019. To operationalize the first 160 beds, the hospital operationalized the oncology, renal dialysis, accident and emergency, trauma and orthopaedics, ICU, radiology, laboratory, pharmacy, mortuary, and other allied services. The hospital was designated as an isolation and treatment center on March 24, 2020 with over 400 beds designated for COVID-19 patients. A formal hospital opening ceremony took place on September 10, 2020. Then, in October 2021, an advanced cancer imaging center (known as the Integrated Molecular Imaging Centre Hospitality and Accommodation Centre) was launched at the hospital.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital Construction Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender and Kenya's National Treasury. As of October 17, 2018, 85% of the China Eximbank loan (worth 8,756,025,600 Kenyan shillings) had been disbursed and utilized. However, the remaining 15% of the loan (worth approximately 1.37 billion Kenyan shillings) had not yet disbursed in support of the personnel and capacity building component of the loan because disbursement was conditional upon the training of personnel (who were yet to be recruited by Kenyatta University due to \\u2018budgetary constraints\\u2019). KUTRRH was ultimately unable to meet its loan repayment obligations (due to the fact that it was generating insufficient revenue) and the National Treasury had to step in to ensure repayments to China Eximbank. Then, in December 2021, it was revealed by the Kenyan Government that KUTRRH was converted into an independent parastatal entity (and severed from Kenyatta University) on January 25, 2019 in order to use its future revenues to recover the funds needed to repay the China Eximbank loan. \",\"On July 19, 2009, the Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia and China\\u2019s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) signed a $1 billion infrastructure cooperation agreement, which proposed 7 projects to be financed by China Eximbank through its preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) window. One of the projects that was identified was the Adama Wind Farm Project. One day later, on July 20, 2009, Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) signed an MOU with the Hydrochina-CGCOC JV (a joint venture between Hydrochina Corporation, and CGC Overseas Construction Co. Ltd. (CGCOC) to pursue the Adama Wind Farm Project in the form of a financing agreement and an EPC contract. Then, on September 22, 2009, EEPCO signed an EPC preliminary agreement for the 51MW Adama I Wind Farm Project with Hydrochina-CGCOC JV. Hydrochina Corporation subsequently undertook a project feasibility study and an environmental impact assessment with support from EEPCO\\u2019s wind study center. Then, on November 23, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development signed a $99,450,000 (ETB 1,646,523,179) preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2010 (31) TOTAL NO. (138) 1420303052010211538] for the 51MW Adama I Wind Farm Project. On January 21, 2011, the Ethiopian Parliament and the Prime Minister's Office approved the loan agreement. At the end of the same month, the Government of Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development signed an on-lending agreement with EEPCO. The loan officially went into effect on May 25, 2011. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The ultimate borrower (EEPCO) was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $117,994,500 commercial (EPC) contract [No. 33.20/12/09] between EEPCO and Hydrochina-CGCOC JV, which was signed on November 28, 2009.  The Ethiopian Government directly funded the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost (approximately $18,544,500).   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $99,450,000 (ETB 1,646,523,179) loan (PBC) achieved a 97% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 7 loan disbursements (worth ETB 1,603,194,607) between 2011 and 2017: an ETB 298,469,388 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 682,737,266 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 266,957,500 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 74,386,618 disbursement on October 10, 2012, an ETB 101,657,404 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 178,986,403 disbursement on July 7, 2013,  and an ETB 27 disbursement on November 15, 2017. The purpose of the project was to install a 51MW wind farm \\u2014 with a total of 34 towers each generating 1.5 MW \\u2014 on a site located 95 km east of Addis Ababa, near the city of Adama in Oromia.   Hydrochina-CGCOC JV was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, consultancy services were provided by the Addis Ababa University Faculty of Technology, while a Chinese firm called Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (or \\u2018Goldwind\\u2019) provided the wind turbines for the project. The EPC contract went into effect on November 12, 2009. The project was originally scheduled to commence on November 12, 2009, and reach completion on December 31, 2010. However, construction did not begin until June 2011. Then, an installation and hoisting ceremony for the project's wind turbines was held on April 21, 2012. Construction ended in June 2012. Then, the wind farm began commercial operations in August 2012.  According to the CGCOC, the wind farm began full operations in September 2012. An inauguration ceremony for the first phase of the Adama Wind Project was held on December 1, 2012.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Adama I Wind Farm Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On December 19, 2013, the Government Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and China Eximbank signed an RMB 1.45 billion ($225 million or ETB 4,302,103,250) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. 2013 (58) Total No (503) 1420303052013112665] for the Bole International Airport Expansion Project. Then, on April 3, 2014, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the GCL agreement under Proclamation No. 833/2014, and the agreement entered into force on May 14, 2014. The loan (captured via Project ID#30915) carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL to finance a $225 million commercial (EPC) contract between Ethiopian Airports Enterprise (EAE) \\u2014 the state-owned entity tasked with administering Ethiopia's airports \\u2014 and China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC), which was signed in 2012.   Then, on December 27, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $117,300,000 (ETB 2,623,784,348) preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project. The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC (loan) agreement, which is captured via Project ID#58583, on February 7, 2017. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds from the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $138 million commercial contract between Ethiopian Airports Enterprise (EAE) \\u2014 the state-owned entity tasked with administering Ethiopia's airports \\u2014 and China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC).   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the RMB 1.45 billion (ETB 4,302,103,250) loan achieved a 94% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 13 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,026,390,597) between 2014 and 2021: an ETB 1,337,936,270 disbursement on June 30, 2014, an ETB 492,880,459 disbursement on September 29, 2015, an ETB 92,355,395 disbursement on December 25, 2015, an ETB 112,708,268 disbursement on June 30, 2016, an ETB 87,995,364 disbursement on October 28, 2016, an ETB 72,608,708 disbursement on November 10, 2016, an ETB 104,044,632 disbursement on December 28, 2016, an ETB 194,937,102 disbursement on May 22, 2017, an ETB 192,560,193 disbursement on June 16, 2017, an ETB 59,554,658 disbursement on September 1, 2017, an ETB 197,578,705 disbursement on March 30, 2018, an ETB 469,626,880 disbursement on March 19, 2020, and an ETB 611,603,963 disbursement on January 11, 2021.  According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP, the $117,300,000 (ETB 2,623,784,348) loan achieved a 37% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single disbursement of ETB 962,974,366 on December 22, 2017.   The shared purpose of these two projects \\u2014 the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project and the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project \\u2014 was to increase the annual passenger handling capacity of Addis Ababa Bole International Airport from the 7 million to 22 million. These two projects involved the expansion of an existing terminal (Terminal 1) with a floor area of 30,000 square meters for domestic and regional trips, the construction of a new terminal (Terminal 2) with a floor area of 74,000 square meters for international trips, and the construction of a VIP terminal. Upon completion, Terminal 2 was expected to have three floors\\u2014arrival, departure and ground floors \\u2014 and include boarding areas, lounges, recreation centers, shopping malls, offices, parking, and other facilities. The VIP terminal \\u2014 designed for use by leaders, senior government officials, diplomats and other dignitaries \\u2014 was expected to includes various saloons, lounges, conference rooms, recreation centers, duty-free shops, an IT center and an exclusive parking lot.   Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is located in the Bole area of the city of Addis Ababa, 6 km (3.7 mi) southeast of the city center and 65 km (40 mi) north of Debre Zeyit. Its coordinates are 08\\u00b058\\u203240\\u2033N 38\\u00b047\\u203258\\u2033E.  CCCC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by EAE. The French construction firm ADP Ing\\u00e9nierie supervised construction activities, while the design of the project was managed by CPG Corporation Pte. Ltd., a Singaporean company. Shanxi Construction investment Group Co. Ltd was also involved in the project (most likely as a subcontractor).   The purpose of the $225 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct Terminal 2 (\\u2018Phase 1\\u2019). The purpose of the $138 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct the VIP terminal and expand Terminal 1 (\\u2018Phase 2\\u2019).  Phase 1 construction activities began in June 2014. By December 11, 2016, Phase 1 had achieved a 40% completion rate. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by January 2018 (in time for the 30th Ordinary Summit of the African Union). However, it was ultimately completed and officially inaugurated on January 27, 2019. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Phase 2 implementation activities commenced in September 2017 and were still underway four years later. On March 30, 2021, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited the new VIP terminal being built at the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. Phase 2 was originally scheduled for completion on May 15, 2021. However, as of April 2022, AidData had not yet found any evidence of project completion.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"During the visit of Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Pakistan in May 2001, the Gwadar deep water port was a key item of discussion. Pakistani Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz said that the Chinese Government has agreed to help fund the construction of phase one of the $250 million Gwadar Deep Water Port Project. Then, on August 10, 2001, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a financing framework agreement for development of Phase 1 of the Gwadar Deep Water Port Project. The Chinese Government ultimately signed six different financial agreements for Phase 1.  (1) In 2001, the China Ministry of Commerce signed a $31 million grant agreement (captured via Project ID#35124) (2) In 2001, the China Ministry of Commerce signed another $31 million grant agreement (captured via Project ID#72688) (3) In 2001, the China Ministry of Commerce signed a $18 million grant agreement (captured via Project ID#72689) (4) On December 26, 2002, China Eximbank signed an RMB 481,400,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2002) 3 TOTAL NO. (95)]. It carries a 2% interest rate but the borrowing terms are unknown (captured via Project ID#38996) (5) In 2003, China Eximbank signed an RMB 502,690,200 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2003) 3 TOTAL NO. (95)]. The borrowing terms are unknown (captured via Project ID #92475) (6) On March 24, 2006, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $22.26 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [BLA05147] for the Gwadar Port Channel Deepening Project (also known as the Additional Dredging Works of Gwadar Deep Water Port Phase 1 Project). It carries a 3% interest rate its proceeds were used to finance a commercial contract that was signed on August 10, 2005 (captured via Project ID#38995).  Phase 1 involved the dredging of the Gwadar port to 14.5 meters. The objective of the project was to enable 50,000 DWT vessels to use the port. The Gwadar Port Channel Deepening Project was an extension to Phase 1 of the Gwadar Deep Water Port Project, which comprised three multi-purposes berths of 602-meter total length and also accommodated roll-on roll-off vessels, a 100-meter service berth, 4.25-kilometer approach channel dredged to 11.5 meter-12.5 meter and demarcated with buoys and turning lights.   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) -- a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Limited -- was the contractor responsible for project implementation. On March 22, 2002, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. At that time, the project was expected to reach completion by March 2005. The channel was successfully dredged and deepened to 14.5 meters in February 2007. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz inaugurated the deep sea port on March 20, 2007. Gwadar Port was then taken over by China Overseas Ports Holding Company Limited (COPHC) on May 16, 2013 \\u2014 for 40 years.  Gwadar Port, located about 350 kilometers west of Karachi on the Arabian Sea coast, is now considered the nearest warm water port for the Central Asian states for their trade with Europe, East Asia, and the Americas.  There are some indications that the RMB 481,400,000 government concessional loan for the Gwadar Port Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the RMB 481.4 million government concessional loan agreement for the Gwadar Port Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-029].

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The Government of Maldives issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $150 million 'EPC plus financing' (EPCF or EPC+F) turnkey contract between Maldives Sun Group (an alternative name for Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd) and China Communications Construction Company Limited, which was signed on January 30, 2016. The scope of the turnkey contract included the design and construction of the Irufen Island Resort.   By the end of September 2018, the loan had achieved a disbursement rate of 32.9% (with $42,061,601 of $127.5 million being disbursed). China Eximbank made loan disbursements to Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd worth $20,715,590 during calendar year 2020.  The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was $106,784,411 as of December 31, 2019, $121,125,000 as of December 31, 2020, and $125,055,695 as of December 31, 2021.  Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd made loan repayments to China Eximbank worth $6,375,000 during calendar year 2020 and no loan repayments to China Eximbank during calendar year 2021.   The purpose of the project was to design and construct the Irufen Island Resort (also known as Sun Siyam Iru Fen Maldives) on the Noonu Atoll, which covers an area of 54 hectares. The resort was originally planned to feature beach villas, showstopper suites, private pools, restaurants, bars, a world-class spa, wellness and sports facilities, a kids\\u2019 village. Its location is close to some of the best dive spots in the region. Upon completion, the resort was expected to become the largest in the Maldives with 509 rooms. The Financial Times called it 'the biggest resort development deal in Maldivian history.' The resort owner of Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd -- also known as the Maldives Sun Group or Sun Siyam -- is Ahmed Siyam Mohamed, who was the leader of a political party in the ruling coalition of the then-President Abdulla Yameen, and one of the biggest tycoons in the country\\u2019s lucrative tourism sector.   CCCC Highway Consultants Co., Ltd. (\\u4e2d\\u4ea4\\u516c\\u8def\\u89c4\\u5212\\u8bbe\\u8ba1\\u9662\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8) was responsible for project design and China Communications Construction Co., Ltd. (CCCC) was responsible for project implementation. Construction commenced in December 2019. After implementation delays due to COVID-19, the resort opened its doors to guests on October 28, 2021. The project was originally expected to reach completion in June 2020. It reportedly employed 64 Chinese workers and 1,193 foreign workers.   The China Eximbank loan that was issued in support of this project has been a subject of local controversy. Due to the fact that the Government of the Maldives issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan, the private debt contracted by Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd threatened to become a public debt in the event that the Irufen Island Resort Project was insufficiently profitable of the borrower defaulted on its repayment obligations. Due to economic difficulties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, this risk became more obvious in 2020. Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd failed to meet a $10 million loan repayment obligation that was due to China Eximbank on July 21, 2020. The next day, China Eximbank warned the Government of the Maldives that, as the ultimate guarantor of the private debt, it was responsible for the loan repayment obligations of Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd., and failing to meet these obligations would result in a sovereign default, thereby jeopardizing the country\\u2019s international credit ratings and its macroeconomic stability. This issue was ultimately resolved when the Maldivian government threatened to exercise its mortgage rights if Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd did not deposit the overdue payment in an escrow account within five business days. Then, in 2021, the borrower made no loan repayments to China Eximbank (despite the fact that the loan's grace period had expired).  \",\"On September 9, 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 810 million (or approximately $121 million) for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Boou\\u00e9 Bridge Construction Project. This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. In 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Port Gentil-Ombou\\u00e9 Road and Ogoou\\u00e9 River Boou\\u00e9 Bridge Construction Project.  The face value of the PBC was approximately 254.4 billion CFA francs, or approximately $534,582,600. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance a $663 million EPC contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Approximately 95% of the cost of this project was financed by China Eximbank while the remaining 5% was financed by the Government of Gabon itself.  The GCL that supported this project is captured in Project ID#60747. The PBC that supported this project is captured in Project ID#73174.   The project involved the construction of a 93.26 km two-way, two-lane highway from Port Gentil to Ombou\\u00e9 (with an asphalt concrete surface, a subgrade width of 12 meters, and a subgrade width of 10 meters), the construction of three bridges (the 4707 meter Ogoou\\u00e9 River Bridge, the 367 meter Boou\\u00e9 Bridge, and the 4577 meter Nkomi Laguna Bridge) measuring 13 km in length, and the construction of 141 culverts.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It received an order to commence construction on March 20, 2014. Then, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2014. The project was handed over on December 23, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon\\u2019s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country\\u2019s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon\\u2019s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, \\u2018the stock of [the Government of] Gabon\\u2019s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-\\u00e0-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-\\u00e0-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-\\u00e0-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-\\u00e0-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-\\u00e0-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).\\u2019 Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon\\u2019s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022. \",\"In 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project.

The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a $2.37 billion commercial contract between Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute, which was signed on April 28, 2009.   As of June 20, 2017, $1.513 billion had been disbursed by China Eximbank for the Chashma Nuclear Power Project 3 and Chashma Nuclear Power Project across all three loan agreements (PBC, GCL, and BCL).   The purpose of the project was to construct Unit 3 and Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant (or CHASNUPP), which is a large commercial nuclear power plant located in the vicinities of Chashma colony and Kundian in Punjab in Pakistan (exact locational coordinates are 32.390278, 71.4625). More specifically, the purpose of the project was to (a) construct CHASNUPP-III, a 315-MW two-loop pressurized water reactor (PWR), using between 2.4\\u20143.0% low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel with a gross capacity of 340 MW; and (b) construct CHASNUPP-IV, another 315-MW two-loop pressurized reactor with a gross capacity of 340 MW.    China Zhongyuan Engineering, China Nuclear Industry No.5 Construction Company, and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering and Research Design Institute were the contractors responsible for Unit 3 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. China National Nuclear Cooperation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) supervised the work of all four Chinese contractors.  Construction of CHASNUPP-III (also known as C3 or Unit 3) commenced on May 28, 2011. CHASNUPP-III joined the nation's electricity grid system on October 15, 2016 and commenced its operations on December 6, 2016. It was officially inaugurated on December 28, 2016. Construction of CHASNUPP-IV (also known as C4 or Unit 4) started on December 18, 2011. CHASNUPP-IV was connected to nation's grid system on June 25, 2017 and it commenced its operations on September 19, 2017.

The borrower was initially expected to use the CDB and China Eximbank loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract between the ESC and the Ethiopian state-owned Metals & Engineering Corporation (MetEC), which was signed in March 2011. However, in 2012, the Government of Ethiopia dismissed MetEC and re-issued the commercial contract to China National Complete Plant Import-Export Corporation (COMPLANT).   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 2,077,702,703 loan (captured via Project ID#30113) achieved a 43.8% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single disbursement of ETB 911,906,704 on July 7, 2013.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP, the ETB 2,533,783,784 loan (captured via Project ID#58592) achieved a 110% disbursement rate, with CDB making 6 loan disbursements (worth ETB 2,283,941,874) between 2012 and 2014: an ETB 387,188,627 disbursement on June 29, 2012, an ETB 261,859,928 disbursement on October 18, 2012, an ETB 215,748,901 disbursement on January 11, 2013, an ETB 417,546,480 disbursement on June 6, 2013, an ETB 484,171,322 disbursement on June 18, 2013, and an ETB 517,426,615 disbursement on April 30, 2014.  The purpose of the project was to construct the Kessem sugar factory, which is located in Zone Three of the Awash Fentallie and Dulecha districts of Afar Regional State. The factory has a total of 20,000 hectares of land to be cultivated with cane & its plantation stretches to the areas known as Kessem and Bolhomon. The Kessem Dam, which has a capacity of holding 500 cubic meters water, is the source from which sugarcane cultivation was to be carried out.    COMPLANT was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in May 2012 and ended on November 30, 2014. Irrigable land reached 2,946 hectares while the construction of 20.5 kilometers of main canal was completed. Then, in March 2015, the factory underwent a trial run. Factory operations began in 2016. However, according to the AMP, the project had only achieved a 99.05% completion rate as of April 2022.   Currently, the sugar factory has 8,413 hectares of land covered with cane among which 6,000 hectares cultivated by a private company known as Amibara Agricultural Development (with which ESC has signed contractual agreement). Kessem Sugar Factory is capable of producing 260,000 tons of sugar and 30,000 cube meters of ethanol per year at maximum capacity.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank and CDBs loan for the Kessem Sugar Factory Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On December 4, 2012, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a $129,825,916 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2012) 54 TOTAL NO. (242)] for the Two Sections of Highway Rehabilitation Project. The loan (PBC) carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 9-year grace period, a 0.25% management fee, and an 0.25% commitment fee. On April 1, 2013, Kyrgyz Parliament approved the loan agreement. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a September 22, 2012 commercial contract [ID#EXMB/KG/0BI-03] worth $129,825,916.30 between the Kyrgyz Ministry of Transport and Communications and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).   According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $32,456,479) took place on September 30, 2013 and the second loan disbursement (of $32,456,500) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that, as of 2015, the loan disbursement rate was 50% ($64,912,979 out of $129,825,916). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 100% as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $131,147,402.32 as of December 31, 2021.  The project sought to rehabilitate the Osh-Batken-lsfana road (specifically, a road section from 220km to 232 km and a road section from 248 km to 360 km) and the Bishkek-Balykchi road (specifically, a road section from 147 km to 172 km).   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in July 2013. The Bishkek-Balykchy road segment was completed on July 22, 2015. The 127 km Osh-Batken-Isfana road section was completed on November 10, 2016. The section from kilometer 271 to kilometer 360 was completed in October 2018.  However, there are some indications that the preferential buyer's credit for the Two Sections of Highway Rehabilitation Project (Osh-Batken-Isfana 127 km Section and Bishkek-Balykchy 25 km Section) financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029]. Under the terms of the agreement (captured via Project ID#96102), the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for the Two Sections of Highway Rehabilitation Project (Osh-Batken-Isfana 127 km Section and Bishkek-Balykchy 25 km Section).\",\"On April 24, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 960 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL (2013) 18 TOTAL NO. (463)] for Phase I of the Hambantota Port Development Project (Ancillary Works and Supply of Equipment). However, the face value of the GCL was eventually reduced to RMB 862,604,893. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.  The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of the GCL to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) \\u2014 the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. The end-user (SLPA) was expected to use proceeds of the loan to finance 100% of the cost of a $147 million commercial contract that it signed with a consortium consisting of China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) and Sinohydro Corporation Limited (SCL) on May 17, 2012. China Eximbank disbursed RMB 237,955,105.04 in 2013, RMB 120,862,986.24 in 2014, RMB 54,326,219.49 in 2015, and unknown amounts in subsequent years. The loan's amount outstanding was RMB 862,604,892 as of December 31, 2016 and RMB 632,576,921 as of June 30, 2022.  The purpose of the project was to deepen the harbor basin one additional meter, dredge for approaching channel, provide additional work on the oil terminal, generate breakwater and revetment modification and handling facilities, provide a new administration and services building, and change specification of navigational aid and price escalation.  CHEC and SCL were the contractors responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 24, 2013 and reached completion on April 24, 2015.  However, Phases I and II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) encountered financial management problems, debt repayment challenges, and corruption allegations. Hambantota Port generated lower-than-expected container traffic and proved to be commercially nonviable under SLPA ownership. Consequently, SLPA could not service its loans to China Eximbank. In response, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) \\u2014 a subsidiary of China Merchants Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) \\u2014 purchased a majority ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years.  More specifically, on July 29, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, and Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) signed a 99-year concession agreement and formed a joint venture to operate Hambantota Port. According to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CMPort acquired an 85% stake in Hambantota International Ports Group (HIPG) and a 49.3% stake in Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), representing about 70% of the total equity. CMPort was also granted the operating and management rights of HIPG and HIPS as well as the lease and development rights of approximately 11.5 square kilometers of land in the Hambantota port area. CMPort agreed to make a total equity investment of $1.12 billion, of which $974 million would be used to acquire the 85% stake in HIPG and $146 million would be deposited into a bank account in the name of CMPort in Sri Lanka (for the expansion of Hambantota Port and shipping-related business).  According to a July 20, 2017 Cabinet Memorandum entitled \\u2018Hambantota Port Concession Agreement\\u2019 (No. MPS/SEC/2017/32) that was approved by Sri Lanka\\u2019s Cabinet on August 4, 2017, when the concession agreement was signed, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans that were contracted for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred from SLPA to the General Treasury. Given that the General Treasury was also identified as the recipient of the $974 million cash infusion from CMPort, many media outlets and commentators reported that the arrangement represented a \\u2018debt-for-equity\\u2019 swap.  However, the Government of Sri Lanka continued to have difficulty servicing its debts to China Eximbank for Phases I and II of the HPDP after 2017. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. This decision to suspend external debt service affected all of the China Eximbank loans that were issued for Phases I and II of the HPDP.  Another source of controversy arose in June 2018 when the New York Times reported that $7.6 million had been transferred from a Standard Chartered Bank account controlled by China Harbor Engineering Co. (labelled \\u2018HPDP Phase 2\\u2019) to affiliates of President Rajapaksa\\u2019s re-election campaign. The New York Times also reported that checks worth $1.2 million (linked to the \\u2018HPDP Phase 2\\u2019 bank account) were delivered to President Rajapaksa\\u2019s official residence.\",\"On September 10, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $333 million preferential buyer credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC N). 2013 (35) Total No. (279) 1420303052013211786] for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project.  On December 10; 2013; the Ethiopian Parliament ratified the PBC under Proclamation No. 812/2013 and the Proclamation went into effect on the same day. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate, and a 0.25% administration fee (management fee). The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 75% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between ERA and CCCC, which was signed on January 22, 2014.   $143 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID#30886), and $190 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID #36251).  This follows an earlier agreement signed November 8, 2009 between China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia for a $349,000,000 preferential buyer credit (PBC), also for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID#980). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) and China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC), which was signed on or around June 27, 2009.   As of March 16, 2021, the $333 million PBC had achieved a 92% disbursement rate ($306,388,654.06 of $333 million). According to official correspondence between the Concessional Loan Department of China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia (on March 18, 2021), China Eximbank made 16 loan disbursements (worth $306,388,654.06) through the $333 million PBC between 2014 and 2021: a $100,707,143.90 disbursement on June 26 2014, a $40,941,780.28 disbursement on November 27, 2014, a $25,384,969.23 disbursement on December 22, 2014, a $15,133,515.73 disbursement on June 12, 2015, a $24,221,555.29 disbursement on June 23, 2015, a $8,858,069.08 disbursement on September 22, 2015, a $12,870,031.74 disbursement on October 23, 2015, a $21,763,228.43 disbursement on February, 29, 2016, a $15,093,235.16 disbursement on August 19, 2016, a $15,901,936.27 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a $3,617,707.32 disbursement on June 14, 2017, a $3,317,569.64 disbursement on June 22, 2017, a $4,129,676.75 disbursement on June 23, 2017, a $5,861,882.71 disbursement on December 24, 2019, a $8,338,128.14 disbursement on March 15, 2021, and a $248,224.39 disbursement on March 16, 2021. The total estimated cost of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was $612 million.  According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $349 million PBC achieved a 60% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 16 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,847,852,378) between 2011 and 2017: an ETB 651,221,131 disbursement on January 8, 2011, an ETB 682,158,333 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 236,792,990 disbursement on October 10, 2011, an ETB 273,157,439 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 450,455,536 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 216,893,784 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 853,439,518 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 996,656,460 disbursement on July 7, 2013, an ETB 236,742,424 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 130,076,628 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 984,252 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 808,081 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 491,459 disbursement on July 7, 2015, an ETB 282,589 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 33,385,378 disbursement on October 7, 2016, and an ETB 84,306,376 disbursement on July 7, 2017.   The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama. The alignment starts from Tulu Dimtu. The main road of the expressway continues 2.8 km along the proposed Addis Adaba outer ring road and then crosses Dukem, Bishoftu and Modjo on their east side. It then passes the old Addis Adama road at 62km and bypasses around Adama on the south side. The expressway ends on the east side of Adama and connects to Adama Awash road. The expressway has 18 km of link road and 7.2 km of frontage road on either side in Adama. The road work involved the construction of six interchanges, three intersections, 77 slab culverts, 36 underpasses and 43 overpasses. The 5.4m-high overpasses are supported by 73t girders, reinforced concrete piers and stone structures. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles and cars can use three of the underpasses. The underpass for agricultural vehicles has a width of 4.5m and a height of 3.2m. The pedestrian underpass is 4.5m wide and 2.2m high. Car underpasses are larger in size with 6.5m width and 4.5m height. Flood discharge was used to size the culverts, which was designed according to velocity, water scouring and water levels. The project also included the construction of two main toll gates and 13 ramp toll gates.   The ultimate objective of the project was to reduce the travel time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project also sought to lay the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. Upon completion, the project was expected to contribute to the development of roadways between the capital city and other regions, such as Hawassa and Bale.  The Addis-Adama Expressway (AAE) is fully access-controlled and managed by Ethiopian Toll Road Enterprise (ETRE). CCCC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project\\u2019s first phase and second phase. Phase 1 construction began on April 21, 2010.  According to Samson Wondimu, the Communication Director of ERA, the project\\u2019s first phase had achieved a 33.6% completion rate as of April 2012. By September 2012, it had achieved a 50% completion rate. A completion ceremony for the first phase of the project was held on May 5, 2014. The second phase of the project (also known as the Lebu-Akaki-Information Technology Park Outer Ring Road Project, the Lebu-Akaki IT Park Outer Ring Road Project, and the Akaki-Goro and Akaki-Lebu Road Project) involved the construction of a 28.1 km toll road \\u2014 with three lanes each 3.5 meters wide \\u2014 that links Adama Town in Oromia State with Addis Ababa. Phase 2 supported two road sections: a 14.6 km Akaki-ICT Park (Goro) road section and a 13.6 km Akaki-Lebu road section. Phase 2 also involved the construction of six bridges, one railway line interchange, and three interchanges at Tulu Dimitu, Akaki and Lebu. Upon completion, the project\\u2019s second phase was expected to ease traffic congestion along the Akaki-Bishoftu corridor. Phase 2 began implementation on May 5, 2014 and was originally scheduled to reach completion within 25 months (June 5, 2016). By November 27, 2014, the second phase of the project had achieved a 27% completion rate. By June 2015, the second phase of the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Phase 2 was ultimately completed on August 6, 2016.   After the completion of first and second phases of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, traffic volumes on the expressway reportedly exceeded 20,000 vehicles per day on the two-lane road trunk road between Addis Ababa and Adama. In October 2019, an official from the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprise (ETRE) reported that around 33 million cars had used the toll expressway over the previous five years, generating around $34 million of revenue for the country. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[a]fter 5 years [the expressway] has earned back only about $30 million in toll revenue, well short of expectations. Ethiopia built the toll road parallel to an existing free highway, and a lot of the traffic has remained on the old road.'  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges.

The loan was then approved by Gabon's President and Council of Ministers on February 21, 2013. The GCL carries a 20 year maturity and a 2.5% interest rate. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance a 2009 commercial contract between Sinohydro Engineering Bureau 4 Co. Ltd and Gabon\\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and the Ministry of Economy and Trade.   The project involved the construction of a substation in Angondje, the expansion of two substations in Ambowe and Bissegu\\u00e9, and the construction three overhead transmission lines and two underground cable transmission lines measuring 130 km in length.   Sinohydro Engineering Bureau 4 Co. Ltd was the contractor responsible for implementation. Its ultimate objective was to better connect Libreville to surrounding areas. Its work was overseen by the Electricity Office of Energy and Hydraulic Resources Department of the Government of Gabon. The project officially commenced on June 10, 2011. As of May 2014, the new substation in Angondje, the expansion of the two substations in Ambowe (Ntoum) and Bissegu\\u00e9, and the construction of a 23 km underground cable transmission line from Ambowe to Owendo (connecting to the Ambowe-Owendo power plant) were completed. Although this project was completed, it precise completion date is unknown.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Libreville Electricity Network Renovation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon\\u2019s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country\\u2019s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon\\u2019s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, \\u2018the stock of [the Government of] Gabon\\u2019s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-\\u00e0-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-\\u00e0-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-\\u00e0-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-\\u00e0-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-\\u00e0-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).\\u2019 Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon\\u2019s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022. \",\"On February 28, 2017, China Eximbank signed an a buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement with Cameroon's Ministry of Power and Water Resources worth $141,839,830 for Phase 2 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of the BCL are as follows: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 320 basis points. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL to partially finance the cost of a commercial contract between Cameroon\\u2019s Ministry of Water and Energy and Sinohydro Corporation. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 90.9% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 6.9 billion) and the its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 69.1 billion.   The purpose of the project is to evacuate 211MW of electricity from the Memve'ele dam (on River Ntem) to Yaounde. The project scope includes (1) the construction of 294 pylons between Nyabizan and Ebolowa; (2) the installation of a 225kV, 280 km electricity transmission line between Nyabissan (Memve'ele), Ebolowa and Ahala substations; (3) deviation of the existing 225kV Mangomb\\u00e9-Oyomabang single-circuit electricity transmission line and the existing 90kV Ed\\u00e9a-Yaound\\u00e9 single-circuit electricity transmission line; (4) the construction of two new Ebolowa and Nkol Nkumu 225kV substations; and (5) extension of the existing Ahala substation from 90kV to 225kV. Upon completion, these transmission lines to Ebolowa and substations are expected to connect the dam to Cameroon\\u2019s southern network and to Yaound\\u00e9. Sinohydro 16th Bureau is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project construction began in 2011 and the dam was completed since June 2017, but energy evacuation works are being built and it is expected to be announced in August 2020.  As of September 30, 2021, the construction of the Nyabizan-Yaound\\u00e9 evacuation line had achieved a 92% completion rate (and at least 280 of the 294 pylons were installed). However, the completion of the project (commissioning of the dam) depends on payment of compensation to the people affected by the transmission line\\u2019s corridor.  The people located along a 5 km route of this 270 km line are claiming nearly FCFA 3 billion (EUR 5 million) in compensation, and as of December 2021, this issue had not been resolved (after several failed attempts and deadlines). In late June 2021, during a special plenary session of the National Assembly, Cameroon\\u2019s Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Essomba provided an update on the status of the project. He explained that \\u201cMemve\\u2019ele hydroelectric plant is already injecting 90MW of energy into the South Interconnected Network\\u201d and \\u201conce the 225kV line is completed [\\u2026] the volume of production injected will rise to 211 MW.\\u201d However, according to Sinohydro 16th Bureau, the hydroelectric power plant will not operate at full capacity after the completion of the 280 km electricity transmission line between Nyabizan and Ebolowa because of the flow of the Ntem River.  The company\\u2019s experts believe claim that the flow of the Ntem River will not be sufficient to regularly drive the power plant\\u2019s four (52.75 MW) turbines.   The solution suggested by Sinohydro 16th Bureau is the construction of a reservoir and the project is reportedly being \\u2018fine-tuned\\u2019 to address this issue. According to the Government of Cameroon, the revenue generated by the Memve\\u2019ele hydroelectric power plant and Nyabizan-Yaound\\u00e9 transmission line since \\u2018powering up\\u2019 from April 2019 to October 2021 amounts to CFAF 45 billion. In addition, the partial completion of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project enabled the shutdown of the Ahala, Oyom-Abang, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa thermal power stations, which has led to a substantial reduction in the fuel costs that were previously borne by the Government of Cameroon. Phase 1 of the project was also financed by China Eximbank in 2012 and completed in 2016 (as captured via Project ID#289).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon \\u2014 with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 \\u2014 by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) \\u2014 or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon\\u2019s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini \\u00e0 Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.\\u2019\",\"In July 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Chad signed an RMB 700 million ($92,029,990.50) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Baor\\u00e9 Cement Factory Project. This loan carried a 1.5% interest rate and a 5 year grace period, but the maturity length is unknown. The proceeds of the GCL were on-lent to Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 National de Ciment Tchad (SONACIM Tchad), a Chadian state-owned company that was established to manage the Baor\\u00e9 Cement Factory. The ultimate borrower (SONACIM Tchad) the use the proceeds of the GCL to finance a commercial contract with China CAMC  Engineering Co, Ltd..  The Baor\\u00e9 Cement Factory Project involved the construction of a cement plant with annual production capacity of 200,000 tons as well as a dedicated heavy fuel oil (HFO) power station, mining equipment and access roads. The plant occupies an area of 17 hectares and it is located in the village of Bissi K\\u00e9da within Mayo Kebbi West State (approximately 8km from the limestone quarries in Baoar\\u00e9). Beijing Triumph Materials Engineering Design Co. was the contractor responsible for project design and China CAMC Engineering Co, Ltd. was the contractor responsible for implementation. To control the quality of the cement that is produced, a modern laboratory adjoins the factory; it is used to analyze samples taken at random to verify their compliance with international standards.   The project commenced on December 17, 2007 and the factory was officially completed and put into production on February 16, 2012. Chad's President Idriss Deby, Prime Minister Emmanuel Nadingar, and Chinese Ambassador Yang Guangyu attended the opening ceremony for the factory. The region where the cement plant is located has three quarries with 7 million tonnes of limestone. It also abounds in clay, laterite and sand, three raw materials that go into the manufacture of cement. The cement plant reportedly employs 300 Chadian workers and 100 Chinese workers.  There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Baor\\u00e9 Cement Factory Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  After a sharp decline in oil prices in 2014-2015, Chad experienced an economic recession and a debt crisis and its government sought to renegotiate the borrowing terms of the China Eximbank loan for the Baor\\u00e9 Cement Factory Project. A rescheduling agreement was finalized in April 2017: China Eximbank agreed to the lengthen the maturity of the loan and reschedule arrears that had accumulated (as captured via Project ID#55744). It appears that China Eximbank did not require the accumulated arrears to be repaid before rescheduling the maturity of the loan.\",\"On July 4, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) and China Development Bank (CDB) signed $30 million loan agreement with the Ministry of Energy and Industry of Tajikistan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Project ID#54106 captures the $15 million contribution from China Eximbank and Project ID#71101 captures the $15 million contribution from CDB. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   Then, in 2012, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC (\\u7279\\u53d8\\u7535\\u5de5\\u675c\\u5c1a\\u522b\\u77ff\\u4e1a\\u6709\\u9650 or \\u7279\\u53d8\\u7535\\u5de5\\u675c\\u5c1a\\u522b\\u77ff\\u4e1a\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8 or \\u0422\\u0412\\u0415\\u0410 \\u0414\\u0443\\u0448\\u0430\\u043d\\u0431\\u0435 \\u0433\\u043e\\u0440\\u043d\\u0430\\u044f \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e\\u043c\\u044b\\u0448\\u043b\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u044c) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of TBEA \\u2014 signed a $179 million loan agreement with China Eximbank for the Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (captured via Project ID#91801). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was part of a trilateral \\u2018resources-for-infrastructure\\u2019 agreement between the Tajik Ministry of Energy, TBEA, and TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC. Under the terms of the \\u2018resources-for-infrastructure\\u2019 agreement, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC agreed to \\u2018front\\u2019 $179 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik Government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik Government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine did not cover the cost of Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Also, as part of the \\u2018resources-for-infrastructure\\u2019 agreement, TBEA was reportedly exempted from paying customs duties and value added tax (VAT) on imported equipment necessary for exploration and development of the deposits. The tax and customs exemptions were scheduled to cease once TBEA recouped its initial costs. However, the agreement allowed TBEA to continue to mine the gold deposits for profit after the expiration of the exemptions.   Then, on November 7, 2014, the the Government of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed two loan agreements \\u2014 a RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 30 TOTAL NO. (553)] and a $178,969,220 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 40 TOTAL NO. (34)] for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The GCL is captured via Project ID#46211 and the PBC is captured via Project ID#71137. Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL was contracted by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following borrowing terms: a 25 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 of counterpart financing. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d. OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. The subsidiary GCL agreement (#T\\u0410J 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC agreement (#T\\u0410J 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.   The PBC\\u2019s amount outstanding was TJS 808,004,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 1,343,913,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 1,436,962,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 1,476,217,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 2,022,352,000 as of December 31, 2020. The GCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was TJS 1,054,408,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 1,259,654,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 1,274,255,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 1,288,762,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 1,610,069,000 as of December 31, 2020.  Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) \\u2014 also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) \\u2014 that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project was designed and implemented in two phases. The power plant was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the general contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. Henan\\u00a0No 1\\u00a0Thermal Power Construction\\u00a0Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 1. Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the design for Phase 2. Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2.   Phase 1 was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (on September 9, 2011), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 took place on September 8, 2009. However, construction did not begin until November 2012. Phase 1 was completed on September 13, 2014 and the first two (50MW) power generation units were put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the power plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and it provides nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. The electricity generated from the power plant is sold to Barki Tojik Open Stock Holding Power under a power purchase agreement. Through this project, 150 Tajik technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajik operators received professional know-how from Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed power plant met 60 percent of the power demand and restarted the provision of central heating to more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the power plant was declared to be a solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages during the winter.   However, it appears that the project\\u2019s second phase has encountered revenue generation and loan repayment problems. In 2018, the Government of Tajikistan reportedly granted a gold mining license to TBEA as \\u2018remuneration\\u2019 for Phase 2. Media reports indicate that TBEA agreed to work on the gold deposits as long as it takes to recoup the costs that it incurred during the construction of Phase 2. Several years later, in November 2021, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC reported that it had completed half of the work on the construction of the gold processing plant and ancillary facilities in Ayni district of the northern province of Sughd, Tajikistan. The purpose of these facilities is to support the development of the Kumarghi Bolo (Upper Kumargh) and Duobai Sharqi (Eastern Duoba) gold deposits. TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC completed geological exploration works on the Upper Kumarg gold mine in October 2016.  There are also some indications that the China Eximbank loans for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a 2021 IMF report, \\u2018[OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d] has significant arrears to the government on [foreign exchange] denominated loans. The government on-lends concessional [foreign exchange] loans [\\u2026] from multilateral and bilateral agencies to [OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d] on non-concessional terms. These loans are denominated in [foreign exchange] and are intended to develop the energy infrastructure. However, these debts are not serviced fully, resulting in [foreign exchange] arrears to the government.\\u2019 A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) elaborated on this point, explaining that \\u2018[a] high rate of uncollected payments for electricity use due to illegal connections, power theft and outdated metering infrastructure contribute to the worsening financial health of Barki Tojik.\\u2019 Then, in March 2023, the IMF published a report, which noted that \\u2018[I]n 2021 the SOE sector [\\u2026] kept accumulating debt service losses, where within a year the amount of debt overdue payments [\\u2026] increased from TJS 14 billion to TJS 17 billion (17.1 percent of GDP). Some 93 percent of accumulated overdue debt belongs to [OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d].\\u2019\",\"On October 31, 2012, the Chinese Government and the Government of Guyana signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Cheddi Jagan International Airport Expansion Project. Then, on November 2, 2012, the Government of Guyana and China Eximbank signed an RMB 825,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. (2012) 32 Total No. (434) No. 1420203052012112030] for the Cheddi Jagan International Airport Expansion Project. The GCL (loan) carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 20 year maturity, a management fee of 0.75% (RMB 6,187,500), and a commitment fee of 0.5%. As of December 31, 2020, the loan\\u2019s total amount outstanding (including principal and capitalized interest) was RMB 673,698,000. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance 94.2% of the cost of a $138,000,000 commercial contract between Guyana\\u2019s Ministry of Public Works and Communications and China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) Ltd., which was signed on November 11, 2011.  The purpose of this project was to expand Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri, 40 km from the capital city of Georgetown, and the Ogle Municipal Aerodrome on the East Coast of Demerara. Cheddi Jagan International Airport is Guyana's main airport. The project involved a 3.3 km extension of the airport runaway to accommodate Boeing 747-sized aircraft, the building of a new construction terminal, the introduction of a departure control system, the installation of a CCTV system with approximately 300 cameras, the installation of passenger boarding bridges, elevators, and escalators, and the acquisition of new equipment. The existing 7,448 ft long runway was to be extended to 10,800 ft to make it a category Code 4E runway and to enable it to accommodate the Boeing 747-400 aircraft.   CHEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on March 23, 2013. Construction of the terminal and runway was originally expected to begin in March 2013 and reach completion 32 months later (December 2015). However, this project encountered various problems and delays. On October 12, 2013, CHEC employees were violently robbed by cutlass-wielding individuals (Source ID: 151254). Then, in September 2015, the collapse of a pit killed a worker working on the project (Source ID: 151255). The country's political opposition also raised objections about the cost of the project and delayed its implementation. In January 2015, the then Alliance for Change (AFC) Vice Chairman, Moses Nagamootoo, criticized the project in the media. It appears the AFC, then-an opposition party, was opposed to the project, supporting its abandonment for a new airport on the West Bank of Demerara at Sandhills. The opposition blocked funding for the project in 2014. Nagamootoo called the project a \\u2018fly by night project\\u2019, and was accused of misleading the public as to why Guyana used China Eximbank to finance the project. Nagamootoo later that year was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Guyana. (Source ID: 151253). As of 2019, the project was still not complete and the Government of Guyana's contract with China Harbour Engineering Company expired on December 31, 2018. In 2019, Guyana's Auditor General, Deodat Sharma, launched a full value-for-money audit into the Cheddi Jagan International Airport (CJIA) Expansion Project. Significant concerns arose about the project running over budget. As of December 31, 2017, $111.79 million had been spent on the project. However, the total cost of the project eventually escalated to more than $160 million. As of December 2021, project implementation was still underway and Guyana\\u2019s Minister of Public Works, Juan Edghill, promised that the total cost for the project would not exceed $200 million. During a visit to the project site in September 2020, the country\\u2019s former Auditor General, Anand Goolsarran, pointed out that President Irfaan Ali had identified 71 defects that needed to be rectified. President Irfaan conveyed that the Government of Guyana would only accept completed works based on the original contract entered into in November 2011. Then, in April 2022, Anand Goolsarran told the media that the Cheddi Jagan International Airport Expansion Project had \\u2018failed completely\\u2019 to deliver in terms of their objectives, outputs, outcomes and impacts, thereby \\u2018encumbering the Guyana\\u2019s public debt [\\u2026] with little or nothing to show for the expenditure incurred\\u2019. He noted that construction was still ongoing after ten years, with a revised completion date of June 20, 2022. He argued that project\\u2019s underperformance was related to the absence of feasibility and economic visibility studies prior to the issuing of the commercial contract (to determine the precise nature and scope of the works to be undertaken. He also noted that the project had suffered from a lack of effective supervision as the works progressed. Additionally, he pointed out that the $138 million commercial contract was awarded to CHEC in November 2011 \\u2014 only ten days before the November 2011 national and regional elections.\",\"On January 19, 2016, China Eximbank expressed its willingness to finance Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project. Then, on April 5, 2017, China Eximbank formally issued a $675.5 million \\u2018mixed credit\\u2019 to the Government of the Republic of Cameroon for Phase 2. It provided an RMB 1 billion government concessional loan (GCL) (captured via Project ID#53116) and a $524,579,992 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) loan (captured via Project ID#53396).   The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 7 year grace period. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 22 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 11 year grace period. Both loans were secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the revenues of the Autonomous Port of Kribi, which were to be deposited by the borrower into an escrow account (known as the \\u2018Control Account\\u2019).  The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development (MINEPAT).   As of December 31, 2020, the GCL had achieved a 21.1% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 64.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 17.3 billion. As of December 31, 2020, the PBC had achieved a 25.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 200.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 31.4 billion.   Phase 2 involved the construction of a 1,102m long quay, the expansion of the container terminal from 700m to 1,050m, and the addition of both an ore and oil terminal.   China Harbour Engineering Company Limited was the contractor responsible for implementation. Phase 2 was completed on March 2, 2018.  China Eximbank also supported the Phase 1 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project (as captured via Project ID#350).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the first and second phases of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon \\u2014 with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 \\u2014 by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) \\u2014 or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon\\u2019s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini \\u00e0 Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.\\u2019\",\"On December 6, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Zimbabwe signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project. Then, on April 8, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Zimbabwe signed an RMB 1,045,139,500 ($153 million loan) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project. The Government of Zimbabwe on-lent the proceeds of the loan to the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ). The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity period, a 7 grace period, an interest rate of 2% per year, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The borrower is expected to deposit the proceeds from the Air Infrastructure Development Fund and passenger services charges at Harare International Airport into an escrow account with Stanbic (to facilitate the repayment of the loan and as a source of de facto collateral). The escrow account is jointly monitored by the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank.   As of August 2020, the loan had achieved a 85.7% disbursement rate ($131.2 million out of $153 million). Additional disbursements worth $27.8 million took place in 2022, bringing the loan disbursement rate to at least 100%. The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $81,231,518.01 as of 2021. The purpose of the project is to construct a new international terminal building at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport with a construction area of \\u200b\\u200b35,000 square meters, a new VIP building, and a satellite command center. It also involves maintenance on the existing 1.6 km runway, parking lot, and control tower, and the transformation of the existing terminal building and fire center. The project will also seek to increase the airport\\u2019s handling capacity from 2.5 million people per year to six million people per year. China Jiangsu International is the contractor responsible for project implementation.    On July 23, 2018, an official project commencement ceremony was held. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 36 months (July 23, 2021). However, this project has been plagued by scandal, controversy, and delay. In 2019, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe diverted $10 million from the project\\u2019s escrow account. China Eximbank then halted disbursements for the project and said that it would not release additional funds until the $10 million withdrawal was returned. It appears that this condition was eventually met because project implementation continued in 2020 and 2021. On February 26, 2020, Chinese Ambassador Guo Shaochun visited Zimbabwe to inspect the airport reconstruction. As of July 2020, the project achieved a 27% completion rate. China Eximbank also made a $27.7 million loan disbursement in 2020. Then, on September 1, 2021, President Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe visited the project site.    In mid-2022, the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance released a report, which provided evidence that the China Eximbank loan for the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project has financially underperformed. It noted that \\u2018[t]he low disbursements of loans is due to accumulation of arrears to active China Eximbank loans [\\u2026] on projects such as the Victoria Falls International Airport ($54 million), NetOne network expansion ($61 million) and expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport ($3 million).\\u2019 It also noted that, by the end of 2021, total external debt arrears to China Eximbank included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G. Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project, $0.5 million for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project, and $73 million for the Medical Equipment and Supplies Project.     As of August 2022, the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project had achieved a 67% completion rate and the Government of Zimbabwe had taken delivery 3 (out of 5) radars to support an air traffic control system. At that time, major outstanding works included refurbishment of the existing building and the procurement of required equipment.\",\"On March 24, 2015, Hu Jianhua, General Manager of China Merchants Group (CMG), and the President of Djibouti signed a cooperation framework agreement for a free trade zone (FTZ). Then on January 18, 2016, CMG and the Djibouti Port and Free Trade Zone Authority (DPFZA) held a signing ceremony for a framework agreement for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. CMG then signed a project contract on January 15, 2017. Three days later, on January 18, 2017, Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. (FZCO or Djibouti Asset Company) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between Port of Dalian Authority Group (10% equity stake), China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings (\\u62db\\u5546\\u5c40\\u86c7\\u53e3\\u5de5\\u4e1a\\u533a\\u63a7\\u80a1\\u80a1\\u4efd\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8) (6% equity stake), China Merchants Investment Development Co., Ltd (CMID) (12% ownership stake), China Merchants Port Holdings Co., Ltd (12% ownership stake), and the Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority (DPFZA) (60% equity stake) \\u2014 was established (legally incorporated) to develop commercial and infrastructure projects within the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ). Then, on November 10, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMP) issued a $150 million supplier\\u2019s credit (\\u2018CMP Loan Facility\\u2019) agreement with Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. The CMP loan, captured via Project ID#59393, carried the following borrowing terms: a 5% annual interest rate, a 1.25-year maturity (with the option to extend the maturity by 8.75 additional years), and no grace period.   The Government of Djibouti \\u2014 through the state-owned Djibouti Port and Free Trade Zone Authority (DPFZA) \\u2014 issued a sovereign guarantee for repaying the supplier's credit. The loan was collateralized by a share pledge over 15.3% of the shares held by Great Horn Investment Holdings SAS (a subsidiary of DPFZA) in a China-Djibouti joint venture called Port De Djibouti S.A., which is co-owned the Government of Djibouti (76.5% equity stake) and China Merchants Port Holdings Company Ltd. (23.5% equity stake). Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. used the supplier's credit (loan) facility to on-lend to Port De Djibouti S.A. (PDSA).  Then, in 2019, China Development Bank and Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. signed a $240 million loan agreement (ID#4430201901100002407) for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. The CDB loan, which is captured via Project ID#85139, carried the following borrowing terms: a 13 year maturity and a 3 year grace period. China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings Co., Ltd. provided a loan guarantee worth $14.4 million (6% of $240 million CDB loan). The Government of Djibouti provided a sovereign guarantee for 60% of the face value of the loan ($144 million). The DIFTZ is a 40-hectare zone that consists of three functional blocks located close to all of Djibouti\\u2019s major ports.   The purpose of the DIFTZ is to support industries such as the logistics, marine, construction, automotive, and home electrical industries. It is equipped with advanced facilities including high-speed telecommunications, power and water supplies, roads and parking lots. The pilot zone has four industrial clusters which focus on trade and logistics, export processing and business support: (1) Logistics Industry Cluster: transportation, bonded warehousing, logistics and distribution; (2) Business Industry Cluster: bulk bonded goods transactions, merchandise display, duty-free merchandise retail; (3) Business Support Cluster: financial services, information services, hotel dormitories, office buildings, training, intermediary services; and (4) Processing Manufacturing Cluster: packaging production, light processing of incoming materials, food processing, marine products, auto parts assembly.   China Merchants Holdings (Djibouti) FZE (\\u201cCM Djibouti\\u201d) was the company responsible for project implementation. On January 16, 2017, Djiboutian President Guelleh and General Manager of China Merchants Group Hu Jianhua unveiled the launch area and laid a foundation stone for the DIFTZ expansion project. The first phase of the project, which involved upgrading and expanding the port facilities of DIFTZ, was officially opened on July 5, 2018.  There are some indications that the $150 million CMP loan for the DIFTZ expansion project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In September 2018, the Government of Djibouti nationalized the Dolareh Container Terminal (DCT), an asset held by PDSA. The change in DCT ownership affected PDSA's expected profits because PDSA's profits included dividend receivables from DCT. As a result, the potential chargeable interest on the CMP loan facility, which would be determined in part by PDSA profits, was rendered invalid. The DCT nationalization also affected DPFZA's share pledge value. On November 9, 2018, CMP extended the loan's final maturity date by another 6 months (as captured via Project ID#97763).\",\"In August 2014, China Poly Group Corporation Limited signed a contract with Uzbekistan National Chemical Company to oversee the engineering, procurement, and construction of a $213.9 million tire plant in the Angren Special Economic Zone. This project was partially funded by a $156.37 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) from China Eximbank to Asaka Bank (a majority state-owned commercial bank in Uzbekistan) and Birinchi Rezinotexnika Zavodi LLC (a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Government of Uzbekistan). The PBC, which is captured via Project ID#54149, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Uzbekistan issued a sovereign guarantee for this loan.  The project was reportedly financed according to a debt-equity ratio of about 70:30, with China Eximbank funding the debt portion. The Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan, O'zimyosanoat, O'zavtosanoat, the Navoi Mining and Smelting Plant, and Almalyk Mining and Smelting Plant reportedly funded the equity portion, although the breakdown of the $57.53 million equity portion is unknown.   The purpose of the project was to construct a tire plant \\u2014 known as the Birinchi Rubber Engineering Plant (BRZ) \\u2014 in Angren Special Economic Zone. Upon completion, the plant's production capacity was originally expected to be 3 million car tires, 200,000 agricultural tires, and 100,000 linear meters of conveyor belts for cleaning equipment per year.   China Poly Group Corporation Limited and CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. were the contractors responsible for project implementation. All production equipment and processes were sourced from China. Construction began on August 28, 2015 and was expected to last 34 months. The first tire was produced on trial on September 1, 2017, and production gradually increased during the end of 2017. The project was officially completed on July 25, 2018.   However, the tire plant and the loan that supported its construction underperformed vis-a-vis their original expectations. In 2020, the Government of Uzbekistan provided an emergency loan worth 40 billion soums (about $4 million) \\u2014 through its Anti-Crisis Fund \\u2014 to keep the tire plant financially afloat. Then, in September 2021, the Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of Oliy Majlis, Alisher Kadyrov, revealed that the tire plant was only operating at 15% capacity. On January 20, 2023, Uzkimyosanoat JSC signed an agreement to sell a 100% equity stake in the tire plant to Tatneft of Russia for 826.57 billion soums.\",\"On March 21, 2011, the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank signed a $141.3 million buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement for Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project. Zimbabwean Vice President Joyce Mujuru signed the loan agreement in Harare. The loan agreement followed the signing of a 2010 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by the Chinese Government and Government of Zimbabwe for the financing of various development projects. Officials from Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance, representatives from China Eximbank and Sinosure signed the MOU. Sinosure agreed to provide insurance cover for various loans issued by China Eximbank. The BCL that was issued on March 21, 2011 carried the following borrowing terms: an 11 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 0.375% management fee, and a 0.375% commitment fee.    However, its face value was subsequently revised to $140,825,714.38. The purpose of this project was to support the development and rehabilitation of water works and sewers in the Zimbabwe\\u2019s capital, Harare. More specifically, the proceeds of the loan were to be used to rehabilitate, replace, install and commission equipment at the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant, the Prince Edward Water Treatment plant, the Crowborough sewage plant, the Firle sewage plant, and pump stations at Warren Control, Alex Park, and Letombo. Some of the loan proceeds were also earmarked for information technology and automated billing activities, the acquisition of water treatment chemicals, the installation of laboratory, the installation of pressure-reducing valves, and the installation of prepaid meters in 500,000 households.  China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation (CNMEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of the project.     This project officially entered into force on January 26, 2013, but it was plagued by various delays and controversies. In 2013, China Eximbank reportedly withheld loan disbursements due to the Government of Zimbabwe\\u2019s failure to meet its outstanding obligation under a 1997 loan that it provided to Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Industries (See Project ID#17125). In September 2013, 19 Chinese engineers joined a larger 46 engineer team to work on the project. Then, in June 2014, the deadline for project completion was pushed forward from April 2016 to June 2015. As of June 2014, several areas previously not receiving water had access and obsolete equipment was removed from facilities, the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant was operating at 70 percent capacity, and two pressure-reducing valves were installed at Warren Park D and Ardbennie.   A month later, in July 2014, an investigation was launched after the Harare City Council was accused of spending $8 million of the loan proceeds to purchase 25 luxury vehicles. Harare City Council insisted that the vehicles were for service deliveries; however, China Eximbank decided to withhold loan disbursements after learning that the loan proceeds were not being used for the intended purposes. As of June 2017, only half of the China Eximbank loan (approximately $72 million) had been disbursed. As of February 2020, China Eximbank was still withholding loan disbursements for this project. There is also evidence that the Government of Zimbabwe has fallen behind on its loan repayment schedule. As of 2018, the borrower had accumulated principal and interest arrears and penalties worth $28,430,361.10.   Also, according to a report released by the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance in mid-2022, the loan was still in arrears at the end of 2021. Total external debt arrears to China Eximbank at the end of 2021 included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G. Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project, $0.5 million for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project, and $73 million for the Medical Equipment and Supplies Project. The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $80,640,308.76 as of September 2021.\",\"On May 10, 2018, the Chinese Government and the Government of Ethiopia signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project. Then, on June 13, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599 or $156 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project (captured via Project ID#60762). On the same day, China\\u2019s Ministry of Commerce and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) interest-free loan agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project (captured via Project ID#66045). According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the GCL carries a 2% interest rate. However, the other borrowing terms of the GCL and the interest-free loan are unknown.  Ethiopia\\u2019s House of Representatives ratified both loan agreements on April 6, 2019. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the interest-free loan to finance a commercial contract with the Government of Ethiopia and China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC).   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP, two disbursements took place in 2020: an ETB 274,488,122 disbursement on April 2, 2020, and an ETB 682,257,203 disbursement on September 1, 2020. However, it is unclear if these disbursements took place through the RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599) China Eximbank loan, the RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) MOFCOM loan, or both loans.   This project involves the construction of the Gereb-Giba Dam on the Giba river and the installation of a water pipeline network to supply water to households, industrial parks and factories in and around the city of Mekelle (the capital of Ethiopia's northern Tigray regional state). Upon completion, the project is expected to meet the water needs of the estimated 400,000 residents of Mekelle. It is also expected to generate a maximum storage capacity of 363 million cubic meters during the rainy season, an annual water supply of 53.65 million cubic meters, and an average daily water supply of 124.43 thousand cubic meters. The project was also expected to create 1500 jobs for local people during the construction phase.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 22, 2019. Then, on March 17, 2020, a river closure ceremony took place and dozens of heavy trucks poured dirt and stone into the Giba river. The Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia, Mr. Tan Jian, and Mr. Debretsion, President of Tigray Regional State attended the closure ceremony, which marked the beginning of a new phase of the project (dam main body filling). Then, on November 11, 2020, after a violent conflict erupted between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Government of Ethiopia, the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia evacuated 600 Chinese workers (including CGGC workers assigned to the Mekelle City Water Supply Project) from Tigray State. The originally scheduled project completion date was March 1, 2023.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"In 1971, DIWI, a German consulting engineering firm, undertook the site selection work, detailed engineering work and a master plan for the construction of a regional international airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in Nepal. The work was performed for the Department of Civil Aviation with support from an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan. Then, in 1975, the Government of Nepal acquired more than 3,106 ropanies of land for the project. A detailed project report was prepared in 1989 for Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), proposing a 2,500-meter-long runway with a terminal and cargo building. At that time, the airport was estimated to cost $39.6 million. Then, in 1993, a detailed engineering survey was conducted by the Department of Civil Aviation. During the mid-1990s Maoist insurgency, the hospitality sector in Pokhara almost collapsed and the airport construction project was halted.   The construction of the airport did not move forward until the tenure of Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai in 2011. Talks between Chinese companies and Nepali politicians took place, led by Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation Post Bahadur Bogati. Then, on September 20, 2011, a  memorandum of understanding (MOU)  was signed, on the Government of Nepal\\u2019s behalf, by Barsha Man Pun, and Lui Shengcheng, Regional General Manager of China CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd. (CAMC), at the Ministry of Finance in Singha Durbar. The then energy minister Posta Bahadur Bogati and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Yang Houlan also attended the signing ceremony. Following the signing of the MoU, Nepal\\u2019s Finance Ministry instructed the CAAN to invite bids for the construction of the regional airport. However, it later came to light that the Government of Nepal had committed to support CAMC\\u2019s bid to win the airport construction contract. This revelation occurred when Nepali Congress leader Deep Kumar Upadhyay circulated the MoU at a meeting of the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which later summoned Tourism Ministry and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) officials over the controversy created by the short deadline given to bidders. The MoU specified that \\u2018the Government of Nepal shall provide CAMC solid and substantial support\\u2019 in the tender for an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that that CAAN would issue for the construction of the regional international airport. Suspecting corruption, the PAC criticized Government of Nepal officials for allowing only a short deadline to the bidders. The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), suspecting irregularities, also intervened, asking the Finance Ministry for more details about its interactions with CAMC. As the project became engulfed in controversy several hundred local protesters knocked on the doors of the government headquarters at Singha Durbar, demanding that the construction of the proposed regional international airport in Pokhara begin immediately. In the wake of the controversy, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said the Government of Nepal had scrapped all such MoUs.   Then, following intense pressure from political decision-makers, CAAN continued with the process and invited bids for the construction of the airport under an EPC plus financing (EPCF) model in February 2012, setting a very short deadline for the bidders. However, CIAA continued to intervene, delaying the process twice. CAAN's tender evaluation committee finally opened the financial proposals for the project in July 2012. At the time, Nepal\\u2019s Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation Post Bahadur Bogati said that China Eximbank had offered a concessional loan for the project, but with a condition that it should be constructed by a company \\u2018recommended\\u2019 by the lenders. Three Chinese companies submitted proposals following the government\\u2019s invitation for bids. The Government of Nepal had estimated the project to cost $180 million, but the lowest bidder (CAMC) quoted a price of $305 million. Two other Chinese firms, Sinohydro Corporation and China International Water and Electric Corporation, quoted $337.82 million and $349.28 million, respectively. The airport project ran into controversy again, given that the lowest bid for its construction was substantially higher than the government\\u2019s estimated cost. Opposition over the construction and bidding process mounted. During a press event, former Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism, and leader of the Nepali Congress, Deep Kumar Upadhaya, claimed that selection of CAMC for construction of the project involved massive irregularities. Several other politicians also alleged irregularities in the selection of the Chinese company without transparent competition. As opposition mounted, the ruling Maoists organized a series of protests and demonstrations in Pokhara.  In March 2014, the then Finance Minister, Ram Sharan Mahat said CAMC's bid of $305 million was \\u2018outrageous\\u2019 compared to another international airport being built with ADB funds\\u2014Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa\\u2014and instructed the Civil Aviation Ministry to re-estimate the cost of building the airport. On April 7, 2014, at a CAAN board meeting chaired by Tourism Minister, Bhim Acharya approved the project with a revised cost of $215.96 million. The price tag had been recommended by a three-member independent panel formed by the government. Senior Government of Nepal officials that were involved in the negotiations said CAMC tried to convince them to accept the figure of $305 million, saying that the additional cost would be provided as a Chinese Government grant and that the Government of Nepal would incur no additional cost. CAMC later agreed to develop the airport at the Government of Nepal-estimated cost. Shortly thereafter, on May 22, 2014, CAAN and CAMC signed an RMB 1,541,017,825.57 ($244,040,450) commercial contract [No. 01/ATPDD/PRIA/2011/12] for the project.  Approximately two years later, on March 21, 2016, the Government of Nepal signed two loan agreements worth RMB 1,378,740,000 ($212,916,857) for the Pokhara International Regional Airport Construction Project: a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2016) 5 TOTAL NO. (1524)] with China Eximbank worth RMB 1,022,810,000 and an interest-free loan agreement with China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) worth RMB 355,930,000. The loan from China Eximbank, which is captured via Project ID#38411, carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 7 year grace period. The loan from MOFCOM, which is captured via Project ID#71852, carries the following borrowing terms: a 0% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a maturity of 20 years, and a grace period of 7 years.  The Government of Nepal used the loan proceeds to on-lend to CAAN at a 5% interest rate (with a 20 year maturity and 7 year grace period) through a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) that was finalized on June 5, 2016. The ultimate borrower (CAAN) was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance the RMB 1,541,017,825.57 ($244,040,450) commercial contract that it signed with CAMC on May 22, 2014.  Construction was delayed after China Eximbank set a condition that a joint escrow account should be set up into which CAAN \\u2014 the project\\u2019s executing agency \\u2014 would have to deposit the income generated from all of its airports. CAAN refused to do so, which delayed the release of the project funds, and construction of the airport stalled. However, CAAN and China Eximbank eventually agreed in 2017 to only deposit revenues generated by Pokhara International Regional Airport into the escrow account.    According the Nepali Ministry of Finance's Aid Management Information System, the China Eximbank loan had achieved a disbursement rate of 53.2% ($113,457,998 of $212,916,857) as of June 30, 2021. Individual disbursements included an $18,528,896 disbursement on April 1, 2018, a $10,280,341 disbursement on August 10, 2018, a $3,461,066 disbursement on December 11, 2018, a $8,737,899 disbursement on January 24, 2019, a $6,968,642 disbursement on July 14, 2019, a $49,806,492 disbursement on June 30, 2020, and a $15,674,663 disbursement on June 30, 2021. The loan's amount outstanding was RMB 827,963,224 ($127,959,211) as of July 15, 2021.  The Pokhara International Regional Airport Construction Project involved the construction of a 2,500 meter long and 45 meter wide airport that can accommodate medium category jets like the Boeing 757 and the Airbus 320. It also involved the construction of an apron, international and domestic terminal buildings, an air traffic control tower, a cargo terminal building along with an airport hangar. Upon completion, the project was expected to increase tourism in Pokhara, which is a scenic lake city in western Nepal and a major destinations for tourists. Once the international airport came into operation, tourists were expected to be able to fly directly to Pokhara. Prior to the implementation of the project, tourists had to first fly to Kathmandu and then take domestic flights or vehicles to travel to Pokhara. The project site is located in Chinnedanda, 3 km to the east of the existing domestic airport.    CAMC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Under the EPC contract, a single contractor takes responsibility for all components like design, engineering, construction and procurement. The contract binds the contractor to deliver the project at the stipulated time and at a predetermined price, regardless of any possible cost overruns. A letter to proceed with construction was issued to CAMC on July 11, 2017. CAMC then began implementation at the project site on November 1, 2017. The Government of Nepal, CAAN, and China Eximbank signed an implementation agreement [No. 2017SSYD001] on February 25, 2018. The first loan disbursement took place on April 1, 2018. An official project completion ceremony took place on or around March 31, 2022.   However, the project, which was originally expected to reach completion by July 10, 2021, faced various delays and challenges. Construction was delayed for months in early 2017 over an escrow account disagreement. China Eximbank insisted that an escrow account be opened into which CAAN would deposit the income generated from all its airports. However, the then Director General of CAAN, Sanjeev Gautam, refused to do so. After intense negotiations, China Eximbank issued a letter in April 2017, saying it had amended its earlier condition, allowing CAAN to deposit only those revenues generated by Pokhara International Airport into the escrow account. Gautam was later removed from office, and according to media reports, his ouster as CAAN Director General was a result of a \\u2018collusion\\u2019 between corrupt officials and business persons despite the risk of the government losing Rs. 6 billion over a dispute with an international contractor.  Covid-19 disruptions also stalled the procurement of materials and prevented workers from getting to the construction site in 2020 and 2021. Then, an audit report published by the Office of the Auditor General pointed out that due to lack of \\u2018technical preparation for the commercial operation of the new airport, it looks like Pokhara international airport will not come into operation immediately, even after the construction is completed.\\u2019  The audit report also said that CAAN would incur financial losses as a result of the project. Then, in January 2023, Dhananjay Regmi, chief executive officer of the Nepal Tourism Board, said \\u2018[w]e have now experienced that a lavish inauguration ceremony does not guarantee the regular operation of an airport. We have to be careful to ensure that the new international airport in Pokhara will not share the same fate as the one in Bhairahawa.\\u2019 [Note: Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa, was only able to attract one foreign airline\\u2014Jazeera Airways\\u2014after it opened in May 2022.] Ashok Pokharel, president of the Nepal Association of Tour Operators, also said that \\u2019[t]he fanfare has ended at both airports now. The government needs to be serious about how to operate them, or the failure of these mega projects could deal a severe blow to the economy. [\\u2026].'  On January 1, 2023, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal attended an official inauguration ceremony to mark Pokhara International Regional Airport being put into operation. The Chinese Embassy in Nepal, using social media channels, officially declared that the airport was a 'flagship project of China\\u2013Nepal BRI cooperation.'\",\"On June 1, 2011, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation (ESC) \\u2014 an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise \\u2014 signed a $150,000,000 (ETB 2,533,783,784) loan agreement for the Kessem Sugar Factory Project (captured via Project ID#58592). The Ethiopian Government provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin, a 3 year grace period, and a 12 year maturity.   On June 1, 2011, China Eximbank and the ESC also signed a $123,000,000 (ETB 2,077,702,703) loan agreement for the Kessem Sugar Factory Project (captured via Project ID#30113). The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin, a 3 year grace period, and a 12 year maturity. The Ethiopian Government provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan.  The borrower was initially expected to use the CDB and China Eximbank loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract between the ESC and the Ethiopian state-owned Metals & Engineering Corporation (MetEC), which was signed in March 2011. However, in 2012, the Government of Ethiopia dismissed MetEC and re-issued the commercial contract to China National Complete Plant Import-Export Corporation (COMPLANT).   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 2,533,783,784 loan achieved a 43.8% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single disbursement of ETB 911,906,704 on July 7, 2013.  According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP, the ETB 2,077,702,703 loan achieved a 110% disbursement rate, with CDB making 6 loan disbursements (worth ETB 2,283,941,874) between 2012 and 2014: an ETB 387,188,627 disbursement on June 29, 2012, an ETB 261,859,928 disbursement on October 18, 2012, an ETB 215,748,901 disbursement on January 11, 2013, an ETB 417,546,480 disbursement on June 6, 2013, an ETB 484,171,322 disbursement on June 18, 2013, and an ETB 517,426,615 disbursement on April 30, 2014.  The purpose of the project was to construct the Kessem sugar factory, which is located in Zone Three of the Awash Fentallie and Dulecha districts of Afar Regional State. The factory has a total of 20,000 hectares of land to be cultivated with cane & its plantation stretches to the areas known as Kessem and Bolhomon. The Kessem Dam, which has a capacity of holding 500 cubic meters water, is the source from which sugarcane cultivation was to be carried out.    COMPLANT was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   Construction began in May 2012 and ended on November 30, 2014.  Irrigable land reached 2,946 hectares while the construction of 20.5 kilometers of main canal was completed. Then, in March 2015, the factory underwent a trial run. Factory operations began in 2016. However, according to the AMP, the project had only achieved a 99.05% completion rate as of April 2022. Currently, the sugar factory has 8,413 hectares of land covered with cane among which 6,000 hectares cultivated by a private company known as Amibara Agricultural Development (with which ESC has signed contractual agreement). Kessem Sugar Factory is capable of producing 260,000 tons of sugar and 30,000 cube meters of ethanol per year at maximum capacity.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank and CDBs loan for the Kessem Sugar Factory Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On April 5, 2012, China Eximbank signed an RMB 1,025,000,000 ($149.9 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement with the Government of Zimbabwe for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: 2032), a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. To facilitate loan repayment, the GCL agreement specifies that the borrower must deposit the proceeds from the revenue generated by Victoria Falls Airport and the passenger service charges generated from Harare Airport in an escrow account held by China Eximbank.     This project involved an extension of an existing runway, the construction of a second 4,000 meter long runway, the construction of a 20,000 square meter new terminal, and the construction of a parking lot. Upon completion, it was expected that Victoria Falls International Airport would be able to handle 1.2 million passengers a year and accommodate wide-bodied aircrafts such as 747s.   China Jiangsu International was the contractor responsible for implementation, and its work was overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe. On April 12, 2013, construction began. The project was originally expected to take 30 months to complete (October 12, 2015). The project was completed and officially handed over to the Zimbabwean authorities on November 18, 2016.     However, there are signs that the China Eximbank loan contracted by the Government of Zimbabwe for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project has underperformed financially. As of 2018, the borrower had accumulated principal and interest arrears and penalties worth $12,715,177.30. Also, according to a report released by the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance in mid-2022, the loan was still in arrears at the end of 2021. Total external debt arrears to China Eximbank at the end of 2021 included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G. Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project, $0.5 million for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project, and $73 million for the Medical Equipment and Supplies Project. The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $170,187,609.58 as of September 2021.\",\"On July 4, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) and China Development Bank (CDB) signed $30 million loan agreement with the Ministry of Energy and Industry of Tajikistan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Project ID#54106 captures the $15 million contribution from China Eximbank and Project ID#71101 captures the $15 million contribution from CDB. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   Then, in 2012, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC (\\u7279\\u53d8\\u7535\\u5de5\\u675c\\u5c1a\\u522b\\u77ff\\u4e1a\\u6709\\u9650 or \\u7279\\u53d8\\u7535\\u5de5\\u675c\\u5c1a\\u522b\\u77ff\\u4e1a\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8 or \\u0422\\u0412\\u0415\\u0410 \\u0414\\u0443\\u0448\\u0430\\u043d\\u0431\\u0435 \\u0433\\u043e\\u0440\\u043d\\u0430\\u044f \\u043f\\u0440\\u043e\\u043c\\u044b\\u0448\\u043b\\u0435\\u043d\\u043d\\u043e\\u0441\\u0442\\u044c) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of TBEA \\u2014 signed a $179 million loan agreement with China Eximbank for the Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (captured via Project ID#91801). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was part of a trilateral \\u2018resources-for-infrastructure\\u2019 agreement between the Tajik Ministry of Energy, TBEA, and TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC. Under the terms of the \\u2018resources-for-infrastructure\\u2019 agreement, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC agreed to \\u2018front\\u2019 $179 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik Government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik Government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine did not cover the cost of Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Also, as part of the \\u2018resources-for-infrastructure\\u2019 agreement, TBEA was reportedly exempted from paying customs duties and value added tax (VAT) on imported equipment necessary for exploration and development of the deposits. The tax and customs exemptions were scheduled to cease once TBEA recouped its initial costs. However, the agreement allowed TBEA to continue to mine the gold deposits for profit after the expiration of the exemptions.   Then, on November 7, 2014, the the Government of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed two loan agreements \\u2014 a RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 30 TOTAL NO. (553)] and a $178,969,220 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 40 TOTAL NO. (34)] for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The GCL is captured via Project ID#46211 and the PBC is captured via Project ID#71137. Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL was contracted by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following borrowing terms: a 25 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 of counterpart financing. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d. OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. The subsidiary GCL agreement (#T\\u0410J 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC agreement (#T\\u0410J 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.   The PBC\\u2019s amount outstanding was TJS 808,004,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 1,343,913,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 1,436,962,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 1,476,217,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 2,022,352,000 as of December 31, 2020. The GCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was TJS 1,054,408,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 1,259,654,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 1,274,255,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 1,288,762,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 1,610,069,000 as of December 31, 2020.  Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) \\u2014 also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) \\u2014 that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project was designed and implemented in two phases. The power plant was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the general contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. Henan\\u00a0No 1\\u00a0Thermal Power Construction\\u00a0Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 1. Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the design for Phase 2. Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2.   Phase 1 was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (on September 9, 2011), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 took place on September 8, 2009. However, construction did not begin until November 2012. Phase 1 was completed on September 13, 2014 and the first two (50MW) power generation units were put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the power plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and it provides nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. The electricity generated from the power plant is sold to Barki Tojik Open Stock Holding Power under a power purchase agreement. Through this project, 150 Tajik technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajik operators received professional know-how from Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed power plant met 60 percent of the power demand and restarted the provision of central heating to more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the power plant was declared to be a solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages during the winter.   However, it appears that the project\\u2019s second phase has encountered revenue generation and loan repayment problems. In 2018, the Government of Tajikistan reportedly granted a gold mining license to TBEA as \\u2018remuneration\\u2019 for Phase 2. Media reports indicate that TBEA agreed to work on the gold deposits as long as it takes to recoup the costs that it incurred during the construction of Phase 2. Several years later, in November 2021, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC reported that it had completed half of the work on the construction of the gold processing plant and ancillary facilities in Ayni district of the northern province of Sughd, Tajikistan. The purpose of these facilities is to support the development of the Kumarghi Bolo (Upper Kumargh) and Duobai Sharqi (Eastern Duoba) gold deposits. TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC completed geological exploration works on the Upper Kumarg gold mine in October 2016.  There are also some indications that the China Eximbank loans for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a 2021 IMF report, \\u2018[OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d] has significant arrears to the government on [foreign exchange] denominated loans. The government on-lends concessional [foreign exchange] loans [\\u2026] from multilateral and bilateral agencies to [OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d] on non-concessional terms. These loans are denominated in [foreign exchange] and are intended to develop the energy infrastructure. However, these debts are not serviced fully, resulting in [foreign exchange] arrears to the government.\\u2019 A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) elaborated on this point, explaining that \\u2018[a] high rate of uncollected payments for electricity use due to illegal connections, power theft and outdated metering infrastructure contribute to the worsening financial health of Barki Tojik.\\u2019 Then, in March 2023, the IMF published a report, which noted that \\u2018[I]n 2021 the SOE sector [\\u2026] kept accumulating debt service losses, where within a year the amount of debt overdue payments [\\u2026] increased from TJS 14 billion to TJS 17 billion (17.1 percent of GDP). Some 93 percent of accumulated overdue debt belongs to [OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d].\\u2019\",\"On May 4, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $186,758,091.53 preferential buyer credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No. (2014) 03 Total No. (297) No. 1420303052013211786] with China Eximbank for the Dire Dawa-Dewalle Toll Road Project. The Ethiopian the House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under Proclamation no. 854/2014 on June 24, 2014. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 6 year grace period, and a maturity of 20 years.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $216,530,065.53 (ETB 3,986,318,506.35) commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) and China Geo-engineering Construction Overseas Company Group (CGCOC), which was signed on March 5, 2013. The ERA was responsible for directly funding 15% (ETB 597,947,775.95 or $32,479,509.829) of the commercial contract cost.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 3,824,329,330 China Eximbank loan achieved a 92% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 13 loan disbursements (worth ETB 3,504,749,269) between 2014 and 2019: an ETB 1,127,312,414 disbursement on December 5, 2014, an ETB 134,979,543 disbursement on September 22, 2015, an ETB 232,092,985 disbursement on January 27, 2016, an ETB 278,697,350 disbursement on March 22, 2016, an ETB 201,034,192 disbursement on June 28, 2016, an ETB 243,047,849 disbursement on November 17, 2016, an ETB 41,534,408 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 51,830,494 disbursement on May 10, 2017, an ETB 321,959,701 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 271,887,740 disbursement on September 25, 2017, an ETB 100,050,872 disbursement on February 1, 2018, an ETB 86,890,755 disbursement on April 27, 2018, and an ETB 413,430,966 disbursement on November 28, 2019.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 220 km toll road from Dire Dawa (Diredawa) to Dewalle (Dawale). The road was constructed according to the following standard: 7 meters wide and 5 cm thick single layer of asphalt concrete, with 2 by 1.5m at the highway shoulder. CGCOC was the general EPC contract responsible for project implementation. Shandong Great Supervision and Consultation Co., Ltd. provided the consulting services for the project. The project commenced in October 2014. It was completed in December 2018. The road was officially inaugurated on June 18, 2019.   Upon completion, the toll road was officially transferred to the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprises. The completion of the project has reportedly reduced the travel time from Dire Dawa city to the Djibouti border from 10 hours to 4 hours. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[t]hus far, there is not much traffic on the road, which leads through the desert and has almost no services or other urban settlements along it. This highway could become financially viable by providing a faster link between Addis Ababa and Djibouti, but only when the missing sections between AdamaAwash-Mieso-Dire Dawa are built. While the AfDB and the WB are preparing financing for some of these missing sections, Chinese financing of the Dire Dawa-Dewele section was premature.\\u2019 To access the toll road, truck drivers are required to pay ETB 200 ($7); mid-size trucks are required to pay ETB 150; and automobile drivers are required to pay ETB 100. As of late 2021, there was no data available on the amount of toll revenue generated by the road.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Dire Dawa-Dewalle Toll Road Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616).

This loan carries the following terms: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.9% margin, a 0.5% management fee, and a 5% Sinosure insurance (risk) premium.  The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a commercial contract [ID# RDA/RNIP/PRP1/PACKAGE - A (C1A, C2A, C3, C6A, C8)] between Sri Lanka's Road Development Authority (RDA) and China National Aero Technology International Engineering Corporation (CATIC), which was signed on December 21, 2010.  CDB disbursed $123,291,010.26 in 2012, $24,315,344.88 in 2013, $22,544,790.73 in 2014, and $7,560,640.44 in 2015. The loan had achieved a 116.3% disbursement rate ($177,711,786.31 out of $152,800,000) as of December 31, 2015. The borrower made repayments worth $11,750,000 in 2018, $11,750,000 in 2019, $11,429,685 in 2020 and $11,750,000 in 2021. The loan's amount outstanding was $93,715,455 as of December 31, 2017, $81,965,455 as of December 31, 2018, $70,215,455 as of December 31, 2019, $58,785,770 as of December 31, 2020, $47,035,770 as of December 31, 2021, and $47,035,770 as of June 30, 2022.   By early 2022, it was clear that the loan was non-performing. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Development Bank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement. By March 2023, the Government of Sri Lanka had accumulated $338 million in arrears to China Development Bank.  The purpose of the project was to provide an efficient national road network that would lower transportation costs and improve the integration of the country. The project sought to construct or rehabilitate 9 different road segments:  (1) the 7.47 km Beliatta Tangalle Road on the C1A;  (2) the Bopale - Kiribbanara - Uadamauara Road on the C12A;  (3) the Flyover at Siribopura Junction on the C1A;  (4) the 47 km Pelawatta Kankotiyawatta Thiniyawala Morawaka Road on the C2A;  (5) the 0 - 033.45 km Thiruwanaketiya Agalawatta Road on the C3;  (6) the 20.5 km Kandy - Mahiyangana- Padiyathalawa Road on the C6A;  (7) the 5.63 km Kalkudah Road on the C8;  (8) the 4.42km Kalkudah Valachchenai Road on the C8; and  (9) the 52 km Paranthan Mullaitivu Road on the C11.   China National Aero Technology International Engineering Corporation (CATIC-ENG) is the contractor responsible for project implementation.Its work was overseen by the Government of Sri Lanka\\u2019s Road Development Authority. Project implementation began on December 29, 2010 and was originally scheduled for completion by December 29, 2014. However, the project did not reach completion until December 31, 2015.\",\"On September 10, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $333 million preferential buyer credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC N). 2013 (35) Total No. (279) 1420303052013211786] for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate, and a 0.25% administration fee (management fee). The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 75% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between ERA and CCCC, which was signed on January 22, 2014.   $143 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID#30886), and $190 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID #36251).   As of March 16, 2021, the $332 million PBC had achieved a 92% disbursement rate ($306,388,654.06 of $333 million). According to official correspondence between the Concessional Loan Department of China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia (on March 18, 2021), China Eximbank made 16 loan disbursements (worth $306,388,654.06) through the $333 million PBC between 2014 and 2021: a $100,707,143.90 disbursement on June 26 2014, a $40,941,780.28 disbursement on November 27, 2014, a $25,384,969.23 disbursement on December 22, 2014, a $15,133,515.73 disbursement on June 12, 2015, a $24,221,555.29 disbursement on June 23, 2015, a $8,858,069.08 disbursement on September 22, 2015, a $12,870,031.74 disbursement on October 23, 2015, a $21,763,228.43 disbursement on February, 29, 2016, a $15,093,235.16 disbursement on August 19, 2016, a $15,901,936.27 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a $3,617,707.32 disbursement on June 14, 2017, a $3,317,569.64 disbursement on June 22, 2017, a $4,129,676.75 disbursement on June 23, 2017, a $5,861,882.71 disbursement on December 24, 2019, a $8,338,128.14 disbursement on March 15, 2021, and a $248,224.39 disbursement on March 16, 2021. The total estimated cost of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was $612 million.   This follows the signing of a $349,000,000 preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, also between China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia, on November 8, 2009. The borrowing terms of this PBC (captured via Project ID#980) were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) and China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC), which was signed on or around June 27, 2009.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $349 million PBC achieved a 60% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 16 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,847,852,378) between 2011 and 2017: an ETB 651,221,131 disbursement on January 8, 2011, an ETB 682,158,333 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 236,792,990 disbursement on October 10, 2011, an ETB 273,157,439 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 450,455,536 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 216,893,784 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 853,439,518 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 996,656,460 disbursement on July 7, 2013, an ETB 236,742,424 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 130,076,628 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 984,252 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 808,081 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 491,459 disbursement on July 7, 2015, an ETB 282,589 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 33,385,378 disbursement on October 7, 2016, and an ETB 84,306,376 disbursement on July 7, 2017.    The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama. The alignment starts from Tulu Dimtu. The main road of the expressway continues 2.8 km along the proposed Addis Adaba outer ring road and then crosses Dukem, Bishoftu and Modjo on their east side. It then passes the old Addis Adama road at 62km and bypasses around Adama on the south side. The expressway ends on the east side of Adama and connects to Adama Awash road. The expressway has 18 km of link road and 7.2 km of frontage road on either side in Adama. The road work involved the construction of six interchanges, three intersections, 77 slab culverts, 36 underpasses and 43 overpasses. The 5.4m-high overpasses are supported by 73t girders, reinforced concrete piers and stone structures. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles and cars can use three of the underpasses. The underpass for agricultural vehicles has a width of 4.5m and a height of 3.2m. The pedestrian underpass is 4.5m wide and 2.2m high. Car underpasses are larger in size with 6.5m width and 4.5m height. Flood discharge was used to size the culverts, which was designed according to velocity, water scouring and water levels. The project also included the construction of two main toll gates and 13 ramp toll gates.   The ultimate objective of the project was to reduce the travel time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project also sought to lay the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. Upon completion, the project was expected to contribute to the development of roadways between the capital city and other regions, such as Hawassa and Bale.  The Addis-Adama Expressway (AAE) is fully access-controlled and managed by Ethiopian Toll Road Enterprise (ETRE). CCCC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project\\u2019s first phase and second phase. Phase 1 construction began on April 21, 2010.  According to Samson Wondimu, the Communication Director of ERA, the project\\u2019s first phase had achieved a 33.6% completion rate as of April 2012. By September 2012, it had achieved a 50% completion rate. A completion ceremony for the first phase of the project was held on May 5, 2014.   The second phase of the project (also known as the Lebu-Akaki-Information Technology Park Outer Ring Road Project, the Lebu-Akaki IT Park Outer Ring Road Project, and the Akaki-Goro and Akaki-Lebu Road Project) involved the construction of a 28.1 km toll road \\u2014 with three lanes each 3.5 meters wide \\u2014 that links Adama Town in Oromia State with Addis Ababa. Phase 2 supported two road sections: a 14.6 km Akaki-ICT Park (Goro) road section and a 13.6 km Akaki-Lebu road section. Phase 2 also involved the construction of six bridges, one railway line interchange, and three interchanges at Tulu Dimitu, Akaki and Lebu. Upon completion, the project\\u2019s second phase was expected to ease traffic congestion along the Akaki-Bishoftu corridor.   Phase 2 began implementation on May 5, 2014 and was originally scheduled to reach completion within 25 months (June 5, 2016). By November 27, 2014, the second phase of the project had achieved a 27% completion rate. By June 2015, the second phase of the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Phase 2 was ultimately completed on August 6, 2016. After the completion of first and second phases of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, traffic volumes on the expressway reportedly exceeded 20,000 vehicles per day on the two-lane road trunk road between Addis Ababa and Adama. In October 2019, an official from the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprise (ETRE) reported that around 33 million cars had used the toll expressway over the previous five years, generating around $34 million of revenue for the country. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[a]fter 5 years [the expressway] has earned back only about $30 million in toll revenue, well short of expectations. Ethiopia built the toll road parallel to an existing free highway, and a lot of the traffic has remained on the old road.'  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On December 1, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya signed a $183.6 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No. (2011) 32 Total No. (183) No. (1420303052011211528)] for the Southern Bypass Road Project. The face value of the PBC was subsequently revised to $176,538,461.54. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 6-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity. The loan is scheduled for semi-annual repayments in equal installments from January 21, 2018, to January 21, 2032. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $216 million commercial (EPC) contract between Kenya National Highways Authority and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on November 17, 2010.   The borrower made principal repayments worth $7,061,538.46 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $14,123,076.92 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was $169,476,923.08 as of June 30, 2020, $155,353,846.15 as of June 30, 2021, and $141,230,769.23 as of June 30, 2022.   The purpose of the Southern Bypass Project was to ease traffic congestion in Nairobi and divert traffic from the city center. The 28.6 km road starts at the junction of the Nairobi\\u2013Mombasa Road and Likoni Road, approximately 10 kilometers (6 mi) south-east of the city center. The road then loops through the south-western suburbs of Nairobi, including the northern environs of Nairobi National Park, Uhuru Gardens, Lang'ata, and Dagoretti. In Dagoretti, the road enters Kiambu County and then turns northwards, to pass through Muguga and end in the town of Kikuyu, in a suburb known as Gitaru. At that location, the road connects with the Nairobi-Malaba Road (A104).   Under the supervision of the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation of the project. The EPC contract went into effect on July 2, 2012. By June 2015, the project had achieved a 81.3% completion rate. However, at that time, CRBC was not in possession of the site for the National Park section due to a lengthy court case by Friends of the Nairobi National Park, which obtained an injunction that stopped KeNHA from constructing the road through the National Park. A court eventually ruled that KeNHA should follow due process and have the section of the National Park that was to be used for road construction appropriately gazetted. Upon gazettement, there were prolonged negotiations around the acquisition of a section of the National Park to facilitate the construction of the project. Negotiations between KeNHA and Kenya Wildlife Service for a grant of easement were subsequently completed and an agreement was signed on September 23, 2015. CRBC was granted possession of the site for the project's National Park section on November 2, 2015. Construction activities were substantially complete as of June 22, 2016 (with a defect liability of 12 months). The project was officially completed on November 1, 2016.  The originally scheduled project completion date (per the EPC contract) was July 31, 2015.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Southern Bypass Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In March 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Kenya had delayed payments worth more than 3.6 billion Kenyan shillings that were owed to CRBC and landowners displaced by the project, exposing the Government of Kenya to financial penalties and additional interest payments. Kenya\\u2019s Auditor General Nancy Gathungu said that the Treasury had fallen behind in remitting 1.2 billion Kenyan shillings to CRBC for the Southern Bypass Project. Gathungu also said that the Treasury had delayed 2.4 billion Kenyan shillings in compensation to landowners displaced by the project corridor. Gathungu warned that taxpayers would be saddled with more financial penalties and additional interest payments if the Kenyan Government did not regularize its payments: '[a]lthough the management has committed to liaise with the line ministry and the National Treasury for adequate budgetary allocation and timely exchequer releases for prompt payments in the subsequent financial year, the project is at risk of incurring additional costs by way of interests and penalties with the continued delay in making the payments.'\",\"On February 19, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka's Ministry of Finance and Planning  signed a $200 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 7 TOTAL NO. (251)] for the Matara-Beliatta Section of Matara-Kataragama Railway Line Extension Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% ($1 million) management fee.  The Government of Sri Lanka\\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Planning on-lent the proceeds of the loan to Sri Lanka Railways (a state-owned company). The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance a $278,200,000 commercial contract between Sri Lanka Railways and a consortium consisting of China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation and China Railway No.5 Engineering Group Co. Ltd, which was signed on August 5, 2010   Then, on May 28, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 508 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [China Eximbank GCL (2013) 4 TOTAL NO (449)] for the Matara-Beliatta Section of Matara-Kataragama Railway Line Extension Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. Project ID#33396 captures the PBC, while Project ID#33407 captures the GCL.   The China Eximbank PBC disbursed $83,460,000 in 2013, $19,274,611.47 in 2014, $30,639,850.95 in 2015, $14,599,733.52 in 2016, $15,919,125.75 in 2017, $13,362,642 in 2018, $6,853,910 in 2019, $15,890,126 in 2020, and $0 in 2021. The PBC had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($200,000,000 out of $200,000,000) as of December 31, 2020. The borrower made no repayments on the PBC in 2018, 2019, or 2020. The borrower made repayments on the PBC worth $15,384,614 in 2021. The PBC\\u2019s amount outstanding was $163,893,321 as of December 31, 2017, $177,255,964 as of December 31, 2018, $184,109,874 as of December 31, 2019, $192,307,693 as of December 31, 2020, and  $176,923,079 as of December 31, 2021. The China Eximbank GCL disbursed RMB 39,290,230.29 in 2014, RMB 83,133,097.15 in 2015, RMB 119,587,111.29 in 2016, RMB 22,708,783.36 in 2017, RMB 65,541,716.19 in 2018, RMB 47,377,642 in 2019, and RMB 118,854,502 in 2020.  The loan had achieved a 97.7% disbursement rate (RMB 496,493,082.28 out of RMB 508,000,000) as of December 31, 2020. The borrower made no repayments on the GCL in 2018, 2019, or 2020. The borrower made repayments on the GCL worth RMB 19,538,461 in 2021.  The GCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was RMB 276,266,140 as of December 31, 2017, RMB 341,807,856 as of December 31, 2018, RMB 389,185,498 as of December 31, 2019, RMB 508,000,000 as of December 31, 2020, RMB 488,461,539 as of December 31, 2021, and RMB 468,923,078 as of June 30, 2022. By early 2022, it was clear that the PBC and the GCL were non-performing.   On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement. The purpose of this project, which is formally part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), was to improve transport in the southern region. It involved the construction of 26.75 km length of single line broad gauge rail track from Matara to Beliatta (and a designed speed of 120 kilometers per hour); the construction of structures such as culverts, bridges, viaducts those required over the Nilwala river flood plain, level crossings, underpasses, overpasses, and tunnels; as well as the construction of four numbers railway crossing stations, 2 numbers sub stations and functional requirements of stations.  There were three contractors responsible for project implementation: China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation, China Railway No. 5 Engineering Group, and China Railway Electrification Group. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 28, 2013. The railway line was completed and opened for use on April 8, 2019.\",\"On November 27, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Suriname signed an RMB 1.4 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2019) 16 TOTAL NO (687)] for the J.A. Pengel International Airport Expansion Project. The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a commitment fee of 0.25%, and a management fee of 0.25%. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $199 million USD commercial contract with China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC).   The purpose of the project is to construct a new terminal at J.A. Pengel International Airport (exact locational coordinates: 5.4527, -55.1873) that connects the arrival and departure facilities, and doubling the current airport size.   CHEC is the contractor responsible for implementation. In February 2021, the Suriname Ministry of Public Works announced that the project was halted for the time being and under evaluation. No other reasons were were provided about the halting of the project.  However, there are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the .A. Pengel International Airport Expansion Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. The Government of Suriname defaulted on its sovereign debt obligations three times during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2021, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that \\u2018Suriname owes arrears to China and India, which have provided assurances, although less specific than those provided by the Paris Club creditors, that they intend to work with Suriname towards a debt restructuring that will restore sustainability. China has consented to [IMF] financing notwithstanding these arrears. [...] An update will be circulated to the [IMF] Executive Board not later than one week prior to the scheduled Board consideration. On the basis of the Surinamese authorities\\u2019 commitment noted above, staff expect that debt to China and India will be treated on comparable terms with other bilateral creditors. The arrears constitute a form of financing contribution to the program. China and India have acknowledged that Suriname will continue to run arrears on their official debt until a debt treatment can be agreed.\\u2019 The IMF also disclosed in December 2021 that \\u2018[t]he stock of external arrears is estimated to be at 11 percent of GDP by end-2021, including arrears of USD 61 million to China.\\u2019 Then, in May 2023, the IMF announced the \\u2018[a]n agreement was reached with Paris Club (PC) creditors for a two-step debt treatment in June 2022, and bilateral agreements with most of the PC creditors have been completed. An agreement-in-principle with bondholders was reached on May 4, 2023. The authorities are actively negotiating in good faith with China and India on a debt restructuring agreement.\\u2019 \",\"The National Water Supply and Drainage Board of Sri Lanka (NWSDB) received an unsolicited conceptual proposal from China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) to implement the Gampaha, Attanagalla, Minuwangoda Integrated Water Supply Scheme (GAMWSS) in 2010, along with a letter of intent issued by China Development Bank (CDB) to grant a credit line for GAMWSS and an endorsement letter issued by the Chinese Embassy. A Project Assessment Committee (PAC) subsequently reviewed the conceptual proposal submitted by CMEC in June 2010. In its report, the PAC noted that CMEC had limited experience with water supply projects and the qualifications listed were that of an associate company, the Tianjin Water Industry Engineering & Equipment Co. Ltd (TWIEE). Hence, the PAC noted that the project should only be implemented jointly by both these companies. The NWSDB submitted the project concept note for the approval of the Government of Sri Lanka\\u2019s National Planning Department (NPD) and Standing Cabinet Appointed Review Committee (SCARC) in July 2010. The total cost of the project which was submitted for NPD approval in July 2010 was just LKR 10,675 million ($94 million), which amounted to just 32% of the final contracted value of the project (which was LKR 33,060 million or $229.5 million). Based on the recommendation by SCARC, Sri Lanka\\u2019s Cabinet of Ministers approved the request for technical and financial proposals from CMEC on July 31, 2010.   Sri Lanka\\u2019s Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage (MOWSD) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the CMEC on November 15, 2010. According to the MOU, CMEC was to submit the technical and financial proposals by January 31, 2011. The MOU does not refer to funding from CDB, and states instead that the parties will support each other to secure \\u2018preferably a concessional loan from EXIM Bank of China\\u2019, which suggests that the initial funding offer from the CDB had been rejected during the approval process and a request had been made to secure a loan from China Eximbank in its place. It also indicates that at the time of signing the MOU, there was no firm commitment from China Eximbank to provide funding for the project. Despite the lack of a firm commitment on funding, and without having seen technical and financial proposals from CMEC, the MOWSD agreed in the MOU not to \\u2018solicit or initiate any proposals or respond to any proposals from any other party\\u2019 for the implementation of the project. According to the MOU, this commitment remains valid (unless both parties agree in writing to withdraw from the project) up to 77 days from the date of signing the MOU and can be further extended if there had been delays attributable to either party.   The Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) that reviewed the technical and financial proposals received from CMEC submitted its report on July 31, 2012. The initial price quoted by CMEC was $258 million, 50% higher than the total cost estimate (TCE) of the project prepared by NWSDB engineers of $172 million. This engineer\\u2019s estimate had factored in a 25% profit margin for the contractor as well. The TEC noted that the CMEC had quoted very high prices for certain civil works and in order to reduce these costs, the NWSDB agreed to undertake the implementation of these civil work items including the Basnagoda reservoir as a sub-contractor. The price quoted by the CMEC for this component was $72 million and NWSDB agreed to complete this work for $64 million, resulting in a saving of $8 million. By the time the MOWSD submitted a memorandum to the Cabinet of Ministers on September 3, 2012, the contract price had been further reduced to $232.5 million. This was still 35.2% higher than the TCE prepared by the NWSDB engineers which already had a 25% profit margin factored into it.   The Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA), an organization tasked with ensuring that SOEs and statutory boards such as the NWSDB are sustainably managed, requested the government to reconsider awarding the contract to CMEC. SEMA noted in its observations that CMEC has already caused numerous problems for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as the primary contractor of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant. SCARC appears to have conducted a second round of negotiations with the contractor \\u2014 in response to a request made by the Cabinet of Ministers on September 26, 2012 \\u2014 to further reduce the gap between TCE and the contract price. During the meeting SCARC held on October 10, 2012, the TCE was first increased from $172 million to $197 million considering the inflation due to the delay in the project start year from 2012 to 2014 (the original TCE had assumed that the project would commence in 2012). The TCE was further increased from $197 million to $216.7 million considering the potential future appreciation of the Chinese yuan (RMB) against the US dollar (USD). The SCARC, noting that the original TCE by the engineers had factored in a 25% profit margin, had requested that CMEC reduce its contract price from $232.5 million to $216.7 million. However, CMEC refused to do so citing the rapid appreciation of the RMB and the price reduction already made from $258 million to $232.5 million. CMEC agreed to bring down the contract price to $229.5 million. Following this meeting held on the October 10, 2012, the SCARC made a recommendation to the Cabinet of Ministers to award the contract to CMEC for $229.49 million.   On May 9, 2013, the Cabinet gave its approval to award the contract to CMEC based on the recommendation of the SCARC and instructed the Ministry and the External Resources Department (ERD) to work towards obtaining a preferential buyers\\u2019 credit (PBC) from China Eximbank to fund the project. On May 15, 2013, the NWSDB signed the commercial contract with CMEC for the implementation of GAMWSS, agreeing to pay CMEC for the design, execution and completion of the works a sum of $229.49 million. CMEC signed a sub-contract with NWSDB for the Civil Works and the Basnagoda Reservoir on October 6, 2014. Then, on August 29, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $195,075,000 (approximately Rs. 28.4 billion) loan agreement for the Gampaha, Attanagalla, and Miniwangoda Integrated Water Supply Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $229.49 million commercial contract [ID#P&P/DB/CHINA EXIM/GAMIWS S/2013/01], which was signed with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) on May 15, 2013. The remaining 15 percent ($34.5 million) was borrowed from Bank of Ceylon, a state-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka, on January 16, 2017.   The purpose of the project is to provide safe and reliable drinking water to the areas of the Gampaha, Minuwangoda, and Attanagalla Divisional Secretariat (DS) divisions and part of Meerigama Divisional Secretariat (DS) division. The project involves the construction of a Basnagoda 3.5 MCM capacity impounding reservoir at Karasnagala, the construction of a 85,000 m3/day capacity water intake facility at Karasnagala, the construction of a 54,000 m3/day capacity Water Treatment Plant (WTP) at Karasnagala, the construction of a wastewater and sludge treatment facility including all accessories and pumping equipment at the treatment plant premises, the construction of 10,000 m3 capacity High Level Reservoir (HLR) at Nikahetikanda, the construction of five 1,500 m3 capacity elevated water towers at Ranpokunugama, Belummahara, Naiwala, Minuwangoda and Pasyala, the supply and laying of 1,000 mm diameter Ductile Iron (DI) pipes for raw water pumping main of 1.75 km length approximately from the water intake to the WTP, the supply and laying of 1,000 mm dia. DI pipes for treated water pumping main of 1.65 km length approximately from the WTP to the high-level reservoir (HLR), the supply and laying of 1,100 mm dia. to 150mm dia. range DI pipes for the gravity transmission main approximate length of 89.2 km from the HLR to existing and new water towers, supply and laying of 225 mm dia. to 90 mm dia. range uPVC pipes for the distribution network, approximate length of 600 km, supply and laying of 400 mm dia. to 300 mm dia. range DI pipes for balance part of the distribution network, approximate length of 30 km, and finally catchment protection. In total, the project seeks to build a 720 km water pipe network. Upon completion, the project is expected to provide about 600,000 residents in Gampaha, Attanagalla and Minuwangoda with clean drinking water.  Tianjin Municipal Engineering Design & Research Institute is responsible for project design and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 5, 2014 (prior to loan approval). However, project implementation did not commence until February 2017. As of January 31, 2018, the Sri Lankan Department of Project Management and Monitoring reported that the project had achieved a \\u2018physical progress\\u2019 rate of 20.27%. As of December 2018, the project has achieved a \\u2018physical progress\\u2019 rate of approximately 50%. As of early 2021, the project had achieved a \\u2018physical progress\\u2019 rate of 68.9%. Although the project was originally scheduled to reach completion in February 2020, the scheduled project completion date was subsequently revised to February 2022 due to various implementation delays.  This project has been plagued by controversy. In May 2018, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga demanded that this project be suspended and investigated on the grounds that it was overpriced. Even while the Rajapaksa administration was still in power, a Cabinet-appointed procurement committee noticed a major difference between the cost estimated by the NWSDB engineers for pipe laying and other activities and the higher prices estimated by CMEC. However, a review committee set up after the 2015 change of government recommended the continuation of the project. The Auditor General\\u2019s (AG) Department also raised concerns about the qualifications of CMEC to undertake such a major project. It noted that the company\\u2019s portfolio showed no specialization in water supply projects and that in the experience section of CMEC\\u2019s project proposal it listed the experience of several other companies (China National Machinery Import and Export Cooperation and Tianjin Water Industry Engineering and Equipment Co. Ltd.). The AG Department also highlighted that even though government procurement guidelines state that only a maximum of 20 percent can be paid as an advance to a contractor, an advance payment of 34 percent was made to CMEC. Then, in a letter dated May 17, 2018, to the Secretary of the Treasury, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge, the Attorney General recommended that a complaint be filed at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) since it appeared that the project was mired in graft.   This project has also encountered debt repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Development Bank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement. As of March 2023, the Government of Sri Lanka had accumulated $338 million in arrears to China Development Bank.\",\"On June 25, 2012, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Argentina's Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $2,099,965,834 syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit facility (loan) agreement for the Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Rehabilitation Project. CDB contributed $1,899,965.834 to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#36517) and ICBC contributed $200,000,000 to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#69134). The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4.5 year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus an 2.9% margin, a default (penalty) interest rate of 2%, a commitment fee of 0.125%, an an upfront (one-time) management fee of 0.20%. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy from Sinosure worth 7.21% of the face value of the loan ($151,407,536.63).   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $2,470,548,040 commercial contract between Argentina\\u2019s Ministry of the Interior and Transport and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on March 11, 2010.   As of May 2022, the loan had achieved an 88.3% disbursement rate ($1,855,660,000 out of $2,099,965,834). The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $504,821,918.39 as of December 31, 2015, $1,230,795,697.28 as of December 31, 2017, $1,478,957,102.66 as of December 31, 2019 and $1,376,381,351.22 as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to replace 1593 km of track along the Belgrano Freight Railway, which stretches from Retiro station in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires through a total of 14 Argentine provinces: Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, C\\u00f3rdoba, San Luis, Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Tucum\\u00e1n, Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy. The rail network even connects with two neighboring countries: one of its branches links with Chile through the Socompa border crossing in Salta province, continuing to the port of Antofagasta on the Pacific. There are two alternative connections with Bolivia, neither of which are currently operating. The first is through La Quiaca in Jujuy province, the second through Salvador Mazza in Salta province. The project also involves the acquisition of 1000 wagons and 30 locomotives. These activities will be implemented as part of the Argentine government\\u2019s Belgrano Plan, which is a set of transportation, infrastructure, production, health, employment, housing, and education policies and programs that target the country's northern provinces.   The rail replacement work is scheduled to take place in three phases. Work on the first phase will cover 535 km and it includes the Santurce-Tostado-Chorotis-Las Bre\\u00f1as section, the Pampa del Infierno-Los Frentones section, and the Los Pirpintos-Los Tigres-Taco Pozo sections in Santa Fe, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero provinces. Work on the second phase is 500 km in length and it includes the Coronda-Santo Tom\\u00e9 and Laguna Paiva-Nar\\u00e9 sections, both in Santa Fe province, and Talavera-Pichanal-Embarcaci\\u00f3n-Chalic\\u00e1n, between Salta and Jujuy. The third phase of the project is 558 km in length and it includes refurbishment of the Tucum\\u00e1n-Met\\u00e1n-Joaqu\\u00edn V. Gonz\\u00e1lez and Met\\u00e1n-Chalic\\u00e1n sections in Tucum\\u00e1n, Salta, and Jujuy provinces. These activities are expected to generate 23,000 jobs, including both direct and indirect employment. The project implies major logistical work, including the transportation of more than 2 million sleepers, 170,000 tons of rail, and 5 million tons of ballast stone.   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corporation (CSR) and CRRC Qishuyan \\u2014a subsidiary of the CRRC Corporation Limited \\u2014are also involved in the project as subcontractors.   An official project commencement ceremony took place on July 18, 2014. However, construction activities did not begin until December 2014. The project was originally expected to reach completion within two years (December 2016). CMEC had delivered 107 locomotives and 2500 carriages by February 2017.  Then, in January 2018, locomotives manufactured by China's CRRC Qishuyan arrived in Argentina. On May 31, 2019, President Macri attended the inauguration ceremony of the first 700 km of renewed railway tracks of the Belgrano Cargas train in the town of Joaquin V. Gonzalez in Salta province. As of May 2022, the project had achieved a 77.96% completion rate.  The Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Rehabilitation Project was at risk of cancellation and loan default in 2016. On July 18, 2014, Argentina\\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $4,714,350,000 syndicated term loan facility agreement with three Chinese state-owned banks (Bank of China, China Development Bank, and ICBC) for the construction of two hydroelectric dams (the so-called Kirchner-Cepernic dams) on the Santa Cruz River in Patagonia. The loan agreement included a cross-default clause, stating that if the borrower canceled the project, CDB financing for a separate project (the $2,099,965,834 loan for the Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Project) would also be cancelled. In November 2015, newly elected Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced his intention to suspend the construction of the Kirchner-Cepernic dams. These dams are located on the Santa Cruz River near the famous Perito Moreno Glacier (UNESCO World Heritage Site) that feeds from the same river, and the Macri administration considered these dams to be too risky on environmental grounds. When President Macri first announced his intention to suspend the project, CDB, ICBC, and Bank of China had already disbursed $950 million under the syndicated term loan agreement.   Then, on March 10, 2016, CDB sent a warning letter to Argentina's Finance Minister, Alfonso Prat Gay, The letter said: \\\"The Kirchner-Cepernic dams and the Belgrano Cargas are major projects promoted by the Chinese Communist Party and signed during the same political time period in Argentina and each one of the ... facility agreements contain cross-default clauses.\\\" The Macri administration subsequently reversed course and announced that it no longer intended to suspend construction of the Nestor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Dams. \",\"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as \\u2018Samruk-Kazyna\\u2019). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as \\u2018Kazakhmys Corporation LLC\\u2019 and \\u2018Kazakhmys\\u2019) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC \\u2014 and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower \\u2018principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.\\u2019 As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

Project ID#95750 captures the $300 million borrowing by Samruk-Kazyna for an unspecified purpose. The Bozshakol mine is a large copper mine located in the North Kazakhstan Region. The scope of the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project included the construction of 22 km of highway and 18 km of access roads connected to the mining production site, the construction of 26 km of railroad, the installation of 130 km of pipelines and 500 km of cabling, the installation of fully automated Production Control Systems, the construction of a 5.5 km long Tailing Dam and related structures, the construction of various permanent buildings (measuring 39.000 m\\u00b2), and the construction of concrete, steel-prefabricated buildings.  The project sought to establish facilities able to mine 30 million tons per year. A $560 million EPC contract for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was signed between KAZ Minerals PLC and Alarko Contracting Group on September 20, 2011. China Nonferrous Metal Industry\\u2019s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was also involved in the project\\u2019s complementation. Mobilization work started in March 2012 and construction of the temporary site building and facilities were completed in the same year. Approximately 42.000 m\\u00b3 of concrete production and 5.000 tons of steel construction were completed by May 2013. The panel coating works of the process buildings started in May 2013. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on March 15, 2015.  The completion of construction activities and the commencement of commissioning works was ultimately held on September 29, 2016. The Bozymchak mine is an open-pit copper and gold mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region, Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan (exact locational coordinates: 41.2586, 71.0647). It is estimated to contain combined indicated and inferred resources of 16.5 million tons with 0.95% copper and 1.58 g/t gold. The scope of the project involved the development of the mine and its ancillary facilities. NFC was responsible for implementation. The project\\u2019s pre-feasibility study was completed in July 2008. It was originally expected to reach completion by December 2014. However, the mine was not initially commissioned until March 2014. The mine was fully commissioned and reached its commercial operations date (COD) on or around August 5, 2015. The Bozymchak mine restarted operations on December 26, 2020 after a temporary suspension that began on October 7, 2020, following political instability in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Abyz copper mine and the Nurkazgan copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 50.16861, 73.00333). Stripping works at Abyz mine commenced in January 2014. At that time, it was expected that the mine would recommence production in Q3 of 2014. The Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Akbastau-Kosmurun copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 48.60611,77.78861 and 48.6437, 77.7102). The project commenced on January 30, 2009. Its completion date is unknown. The Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Zhomart copper mine, which exploits the 14 km long Zhaman-Aybat orefield deposits that are located approximately 160 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The first stage of the mine\\u2019s development was commissioned in 2006 with a planned capacity of around 4 million tons of ore a year. The second phase of the project was schedule for implementation from 2012 to 2017 with a production start in 2018. The de facto completion date of the $300 million loan that Samruk-Kazyna contracted for an unspecified purpose was January 2013 (when it was fully repaid).\",\"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as \\u2018Samruk-Kazyna\\u2019).

However, the mine was not initially commissioned until March 2014. The mine was fully commissioned and reached its commercial operations date (COD) on or around August 5, 2015. The Bozymchak mine restarted operations on December 26, 2020 after a temporary suspension that began on October 7, 2020, following political instability in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Abyz copper mine and the Nurkazgan copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 50.16861, 73.00333). Stripping works at Abyz mine commenced in January 2014. At that time, it was expected that the mine would recommence production in Q3 of 2014. The Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Akbastau-Kosmurun copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 48.60611,77.78861 and 48.6437, 77.7102). The project commenced on January 30, 2009. Its completion date is unknown. The Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Zhomart copper mine, which exploits the 14 km long Zhaman-Aybat orefield deposits that are located approximately 160 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The first stage of the mine\\u2019s development was commissioned in 2006 with a planned capacity of around 4 million tons of ore a year. The second phase of the project was schedule for implementation from 2012 to 2017 with a production start in 2018. The de facto completion date of the $300 million loan that Samruk-Kazyna contracted for an unspecified purpose was January 2013 (when it was fully repaid).\",\"On January 27, 2011, China Eximbank and Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) signed a $200 million buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Naypyidaw International Airport Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the BCL are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds from the BCL to finance two EPC contracts: $94.8 million EPC contract that was signed by China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and Myanmar's Ministry of Transport in May 2010, and a $117 million EPC contract that was signed by China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) and Myanmar's Ministry of Transport on December 15, 2010.   The purpose of the project was to construct an international airport in the city of Naypyidaw with the capacity to handle 3.5 million passengers a year. More specifically, it involved the construction and installation of a Passenger Terminal Building, Apron & Remote Parking, Runway, Taxiway, Bridges, Departure Control System, Terminal Electrical System, Control Tower, Firefighting System and a Ground Handling System. The project was implemented in two \\u2018lots\\u2019 and each lot was supported by a separate EPC contract.  The project commenced on January 26, 2011 and it was officially completed when the airport was inaugurated on December 19, 2011. A final acceptance certificate (FAC) was issued by the project owner in 2013. The project\\u2019s originally anticipated end date was July 2014.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Naypyidaw International Airport Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 3 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreements, 6 government concessional loan (GCL) agreements, and 27 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreements (as captured via Project ID#98029).  Debt service payments under many of these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#96221).\",\"On May 15, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $2,490,760,000 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project. The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The loan was also backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (SINOSURE). China Eximbank provided the loan in three separate loan tranches. The first tranche is worth $1,289,029,000 (captured via Project ID#70086) and it supported the Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project. The second tranche is worth $981,260,000 (captured via Project ID#70085) and it supported the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project.  The third tranche is worth $220,471,000 (captured via Project ID#70083) and it supported the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $1,289,029,000 China Eximbank loan tranche to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,841,470,000.00 commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), which was signed on October 25, 2011 (and modified on November 5, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 15, 2013) to support the construction of a 329 km Sebeta (Addis Ababa) to Miesso section of the railway. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $981,260,000 China Eximbank loan to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,401,800,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the ERC and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on December 16, 2011 (and modified on November 2, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 8, 2013) to support the construction of a 339 km section of the railway that runs from Miesso (Meiso) to Dewelle (Dewanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $220,471,000 China Eximbank loan to finance approximately 85% of a $259 million commercial contract between China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and the ERC, which was signed in March 2013 to support the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The purpose of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east \\u2014 via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso \\u2014 to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The purpose of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was to acquire 5 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives, 30 railway passenger cars and 1,100 railway freight cars for the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway.  * Loan Disbursements: According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $1,289,029,000 (ETB 24,004,264,432) loan tranche for the Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 14 loan disbursements (worth ETB 24,905,259,256) between 2014 and 2020: an ETB 1,062,992,126 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 5,420,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,303,030,303 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 5,597,115,886 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 1,808,159 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 1,740,583,177 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 825,731,677 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 2,165,153,034 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 143,690,666 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 923,238,863 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 325,274,645 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 372,159,087 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB  1,422,471,270 disbursement on September 20, 2017, and an ETB 2,602,010,364 disbursement on November 12, 2020. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP, the $981,260,000 (ETB 18,272,998,138) loan tranche for the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 75% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth ETB 13,669,737,755 ) between 2014 and 2017: an ETB 5,580,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,585,858,586 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 1,515,331,236 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 243,681,645 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 1,660,143,553 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 1,092,814,700 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 448,108,619 disbursement on January 7, 2017, and an ETB 543,799,417 disbursement on July 7, 2017. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $220,471,000 (ETB 4,105,605,214) loan tranche for the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project achieved a 115% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 12 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,738,085,121) between 2014 and 2021: an ETB 665,417,485 disbursement on December 4, 2014, an ETB 160,812,787 disbursement on August 4, 2015, an ETB 153,698,778 disbursement on September 8, 2015, an ETB 59,771,749 disbursement on December 14, 2015, an ETB 102,465,859 disbursement on December 21, 2015, an ETB 91,306,426 disbursement on February 18, 2016, an ETB 119,581,905 disbursement on May 26, 2015, an ETB 1,969,772,945 disbursement on June 8, 2016, an ETB 298,939,684 disbursement on October 28, 2016, an ETB 166,925,102 disbursement on April 6, 2017, an ETB 245,832,231 disbursement on June 21, 2019,  and an ETB 703,560,172 disbursement on January 20, 2021.  * Project Design:  The 759 km Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway (\\u2018Yali Railway\\u2019) is the only railway line connecting landlocked Ethiopia with a Djibouti Port. The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo\\u2013Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash\\u2013Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti\\u2013Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway\\u2019s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016). The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015. In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives \\u2014 that carry passengers and freight \\u2014  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and \\u4e2d\\u571f\\u96c6\\u56e2\\u4e0e\\u4e2d\\u94c1\\u4e8c\\u5c40\\u4e9a\\u5409\\u94c1\\u8def\\u8054\\u8425\\u4f53\\u516c\\u53f8) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project\\u2019s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs, as well as revenues, are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country\\u2019s GDP) had been restructured\\u2014and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country\\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country\\u2019s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  \\u2018Overvoltage\\u2019 problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.\",\"On June 28, 2012, China Development Bank Corporation (CDB) signed a $214,200,000 loan agreement [ID# 4510201201100000017] with the Government of Sri Lanka for the Moragahakanda Development Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.90% margin, a grace period of 4 years, a 16 year maturity, a 0.5% management fee, and a 5.9% Sinosure insurance (risk) premium. The loan was apparently secured by (i.e. collateralized against) cash deposits in an escrow account.   $214.2 million was received from CDB on June 29, 2012 and $64.34 million was disbursed on August 24, 2012. Between 2013 and 2015, CDB disbursed an additional $66.86 million. Then, in 2016, an additional $43.9 million with disbursed. The loan had achieved an 81.7% disbursement rate ($175.1 million out of $214.2 million) as of December 31, 2016. CDB disbursed $29,973,757 in 2017, $4,821,082 in 2018, $0 in 2019, $5,104,550 in 2020, and $0 in 2021. The loan had achieved a 100.3% disbursement rate ($214,999,389 out of $214,200,000) as of December 31, 2021. The borrower made repayments worth $20,000,000 in 2018, $20,000,000 in 2019, $20,000,000 in 2020 and $20,000,000 in 2021. The loan's amount outstanding was $160,749,268 as of December 31, 2017, $145,570,350 as of December 31, 2018, $125,570,350 as of December 31, 2019, $110,674,900 as of December 31, 2020, $90,674,900 as of December 31, 2021, and $80,674,900 as of June 30, 2022.   By early 2022, it was clear that the loan was non-performing. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Development Bank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.  By March 2023, the Government of Sri Lanka had accumulated $338 million in arrears to China Development Bank.  The purpose of the project, which was also known as the \\u2018Construction of Head Work of Moragahakanda Reservoir Project\\u2019 and the \\u2018Three Gorges Project in Sri Lanka,\\u2019 was to provide water for irrigation purposes for those living in northern region of Sri Lanka. Another goal of the project was to supply drinking water to millions of local people. It is also expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, addressing a long-term need for domestic and industrial electricity demand in the north-central, northern and eastern provinces. To achieve these goals, a 61m high and 465m long dam was constructed and reservoir was impounded. Upon completion, it was expected that the Moragahakanda reservoir would hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 hectares. The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on January 25, 2012. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in February 2013. On May 31, 2017 the four units of the Moragahakanda Dam completed debugging ahead of grid connection. Reservoir impoundment took place on January 11, 2017. An official project completion ceremony was organized on January 8, 2018.   The Moragahakanda dam is located across the Amban River at Elahera, in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. Its locational coordinates are 07\\u00b041\\u203256\\u2033N 80\\u00b046\\u203212\\u2033E. The intended beneficiaries of the Moragahakanda Development Project, which included the construction of the dam and other activities, were people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.\",\"On December 23, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project. Then, on March 5, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2010) 17 TOTAL NO. (314) 120003992010110252] worth RMB 1,225,602,725 ($209 million) for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project. The GCL (loan) carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a commitment fee of 0.5%, and a management fee of 0.5%. The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of the loan to Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd (a Sri Lankan state-owned enterprise).  The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract [No. HIA2009.11] between Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd, which was signed on November 27, 2009.   China Eximbank disbursed RMB 330,7145,000 ($48.85 million) in 2010, RMB 334,126,760 ($51.7 million) in 2011, an unknown RMB amount in 2012, RMB 158,954,168.72 in 2013, and RMB 44,863,372.18 in 2014.  The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was RMB 1,103,042,453 as of December 31, 2016, RMB 950,339,752.16 (LKR 24,587,000,000/$134 million) as of December 31, 2019, and RMB 653,654,787 as of June 30, 2022.   The purpose of the project was to construct an alternative airport, located in Mattala, to the Bandaranaike international Airport.  The project involved the construction of a 4 km runway, a parking apron, a taxiway connecting the runaway and the apron, a terminal building, cargo storage, a fuel arm, and a fire service building.   China Harbour Engineering Company was the contractor responsible for project implementation.  Construction began on November 17, 2009. The construction of the runway, apron and taxiways was completed ahead of schedule in February 2012. On January 24, 2013, Sri Lanka\\u2019s Minister of Civil Aviation Piyankara Jayaratne reported to parliament that the airport would be declared open on March 18, 2013. On October 16, 2012, a Hawker Beechcraft B200 King Air of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority became the first aircraft to land at the new airport. The airport was opened for flight operations, as planned, on March 18, 2013. President Rajapaksa, his ministers, and other dignitaries arrived in a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A340 to attend the inauguration ceremony.   This project was plagued by cost overruns and controversy. It ultimately cost $243.7 million to implement the project. However, the original budget for the project was $209 million. The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is also widely considered to be a commercial failure. The construction of the 12,000 square meters terminal building was originally designed to support as many as one million travelers per year, and the government envisioned major international carriers bringing travelers from Beijing, Chennai, Dubai, Riyadh, and Bangkok to Hambantota for sporting events, international conferences, eco-tourism, and nightlife. However, it was eventually dubbed \\u2018the world\\u2019s emptiest international airport.\\u2019  Sri Lanka\\u2019s aviation minister reported to parliament in 2014 that the airport had only earned $123 in revenue in a single month, and when a visiting journalist asked a senior government official about the airport, he indicated, \\u201cwhen I visited the airport there, I asked the sole immigration officer how many passports she\\u2019d stamped that day. She said, \\u2018One\\u2019.\\u201d Within only a few years of becoming fully operational, the airport was running an annual financial loss of $18 million. Consequently, the airport failed to generate sufficient revenue to facilitate loan repayment. in January 2015, Maithripala Sirisena was elected President of Sri Lanka and one of his first orders was to allow SriLankan Airlines to cancel all flights to Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport.  The national carrier released a public statement that read: \\u2018[T]he reality is Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is not needed and is a distraction in Sri Lankan\\u2019s efforts to turn itself around. \\u2026 SriLankan Airlines continues to be highly unprofitable and having to meet the political requirement of developing and operating a second hub [in Hambantota district] will make it even harder to meet its targets for financial improvement.\\u2019   Then, in 2017, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loan that was contracted for the construction of Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project was transferred from Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd to the General Treasury.   On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement (including the loan for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project).\",\"On June 2, 2011, China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a $208 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No. (2011)18 TOTAL NO. (169)] for the Southern Power Grid Reconstruction Project. The Kyrgyz Parliament ratified the loan (PBC) agreement on June 13, 2011. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee ($520,000). The final maturity date of the loan is September 21, 2031. On August 3, 2011, the State Agency for Budget Credit Management under the Ministry of Finance of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic entered into a subsidiary loan agreement (on-lending arrangement) with National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan, OJSC (or Joint Stock Company \\u201cNational Grid of Kyrgyzstan\\u201d or OJSC Natsionalnaya Elektricheskaya set Kyrgyzstana or OJSC NES of Kyrgyzstan or NEGK). The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the end-user (ultimate borrower) \\u2014 National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan, OJSC \\u2014 to finance 100% of the cost of its $208 million commercial contract (ID#166-69/0093) with Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd. (TBEA), which was signed on October 15, 2009.   According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $41,200,000) took place on December 21, 2011; the second loan disbursement (of $130,881,100) took place on December 31, 2012; the third loan disbursement (of $25,276,200) took place on December 31, 2013; and the fourth loan disbursement (of $183,030.90) took place on June 1, 2015. The same source notes that, as of 2015, the loan disbursement rate was 94.9% (with total loan disbursements amounting to $197,540,330.90). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, the loan had achieved a disbursement rate of 100% as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $161,617,074.71 as of December 31, 2021.   The Southern Power Grid Reconstruction Project involved the construction of a 500 kV Datka power station in Jalal-Abad (see Project ID#39619) and the construction of 220 kV power transmission lines in Batken, Jalal-Abad, and Osh stretching for 256.5 km.   TBEA was the contractor responsible for project implementation. On August 30, 2011, construction commenced. The project was completed on June 20, 2013.   However, the Southern Power Grid Reconstruction Project has underperformed from a revenue generation and debt repayment perspective. On December 9, 2019, a Settlement Agreement was signed by Joint Stock Company \\u201cNational Grid of Kyrgyzstan\\u201d and the State Agency for Budget Credit Management under the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, overdue repayments (arrears) were included in an updated repayment schedule (amortization table) without any change to the loan\\u2019s final maturity date. According to the audited financial statement of Joint Stock Company \\u201cNational Grid of Kyrgyzstan\\u201d for the year that ended on December 31, 2019, \\u2018[t]his restructuring [\\u2026] led to significant changes in the amortized cost of loans from the Export-Import Bank of China.\\u2019 Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029]. Under the terms of the agreement (captured via Project ID#96102), the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for the Southern Power Grid Reconstruction Project.  The original loan (PBC) that was issued on June 2, 2011 is captured via Project ID#40431. The December 2019 rescheduling is captured via Project ID#96098. The July 2021 rescheduling is captured via Project ID#96102.\",\"On December 19, 2013, the Government Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development and China Eximbank signed an RMB 1.45 billion ($225 million or ETB 4,302,103,250) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. 2013 (58) Total No (503) 1420303052013112665] for the Bole International Airport Expansion Project. Then, on April 3, 2014, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the GCL agreement under Proclamation No. 833/2014, and the agreement entered into force on May 14, 2014. The loan (captured via Project ID#30915) carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL to finance a $225 million commercial (EPC) contract between Ethiopian Airports Enterprise (EAE) \\u2014 the state-owned entity tasked with administering Ethiopia's airports \\u2014 and China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC), which was signed in 2012.   Then, on December 27, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $117,300,000 (ETB 2,623,784,348) preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project. The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC (loan) agreement, which is captured via Project ID#58583, on February 7, 2017. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds from the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $138 million commercial contract between Ethiopian Airports Enterprise (EAE) \\u2014 the state-owned entity tasked with administering Ethiopia's airports \\u2014 and China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC).   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the RMB 1.45 billion (ETB 4,302,103,250) loan achieved a 94% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 13 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,026,390,597) between 2014 and 2021: an ETB 1,337,936,270 disbursement on June 30, 2014, an ETB 492,880,459 disbursement on September 29, 2015, an ETB 92,355,395 disbursement on December 25, 2015, an ETB 112,708,268 disbursement on June 30, 2016, an ETB 87,995,364 disbursement on October 28, 2016, an ETB 72,608,708 disbursement on November 10, 2016, an ETB 104,044,632 disbursement on December 28, 2016, an ETB 194,937,102 disbursement on May 22, 2017, an ETB 192,560,193 disbursement on June 16, 2017, an ETB 59,554,658 disbursement on September 1, 2017, an ETB 197,578,705 disbursement on March 30, 2018, an ETB 469,626,880 disbursement on March 19, 2020, and an ETB 611,603,963 disbursement on January 11, 2021.  According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP, the $117,300,000 (ETB 2,623,784,348) loan achieved a 37% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single disbursement of ETB 962,974,366 on December 22, 2017.   The shared purpose of these two projects \\u2014 the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project and the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project \\u2014 was to increase the annual passenger handling capacity of Addis Ababa Bole International Airport from the 7 million to 22 million. These two projects involved the expansion of an existing terminal (Terminal 1) with a floor area of 30,000 square meters for domestic and regional trips, the construction of a new terminal (Terminal 2) with a floor area of 74,000 square meters for international trips, and the construction of a VIP terminal. Upon completion, Terminal 2 was expected to have three floors\\u2014arrival, departure and ground floors \\u2014 and include boarding areas, lounges, recreation centers, shopping malls, offices, parking, and other facilities. The VIP terminal \\u2014 designed for use by leaders, senior government officials, diplomats and other dignitaries \\u2014 was expected to includes various saloons, lounges, conference rooms, recreation centers, duty-free shops, an IT center and an exclusive parking lot.   Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is located in the Bole area of the city of Addis Ababa, 6 km (3.7 mi) southeast of the city center and 65 km (40 mi) north of Debre Zeyit. Its coordinates are 08\\u00b058\\u203240\\u2033N 38\\u00b047\\u203258\\u2033E.  CCCC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by EAE. The French construction firm ADP Ing\\u00e9nierie supervised construction activities, while the design of the project was managed by CPG Corporation Pte. Ltd., a Singaporean company. Shanxi Construction investment Group Co. Ltd was also involved in the project (most likely as a subcontractor).   The purpose of the $225 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct Terminal 2 (\\u2018Phase 1\\u2019). The purpose of the $138 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct the VIP terminal and expand Terminal 1 (\\u2018Phase 2\\u2019).  Phase 1 construction activities began in June 2014. By December 11, 2016, Phase 1 had achieved a 40% completion rate. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by January 2018 (in time for the 30th Ordinary Summit of the African Union). However, it was ultimately completed and officially inaugurated on January 27, 2019. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Phase 2 implementation activities commenced in September 2017 and were still underway four years later. On March 30, 2021, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited the new VIP terminal being built at the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. Phase 2 was originally scheduled for completion on May 15, 2021. However, as of April 2022, AidData had not yet found any evidence of project completion.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On October 25, 2007, Black Gold Drilling LLC \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and subsidiary of Schahin (a Brazilian construction firm) \\u2014 signed a $800 million senior, secured, syndicated loan agreement with about 15 banks to finance the construction of two semi-submersible drilling platforms. China Development Bank (CDB) contributed $150 million to the syndicate. The loan carried a 10 year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2.375% margin prior to completion of construction for the platforms (3.5 years), and LIBOR plus a 2% margin post-completion. The interest rate had the potential to drop further depending on the platforms' profit margins during operation (5-7 years).  Additionally, a $80 million completion letter of credit, a completion guarantee from Schahin Engenharia, and a comfort letter from Schahin were all provided to mitigate risk for lenders.  The participants in the loan syndicate included four bookrunners/mandated lead arrangers, Mizuho Financial Group, Standard Chartered Bank, UniCredit, and WestLB, all of which contributed about $57.86 million. Dexia Group served as the senior lead arranger, and KfW and HSH-Nordbank served as arrangers, and also contributed about $57.86 million each. BBVA, SanPaolo IMI, Shinhan, and Itau BBA were all co-arrangers, and contributed $50 million, $50 million, $40 million, and $30 million respectively. Caterpillar and Nordkap were participants, contributing $15 million and $10 million respectively. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) contributed a $50 million loan as a participant as well. Some sources indicate multiple Chinese banks were involved in the syndicate, one source specifying the China Construction Bank.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance the construction of two semi submersible drilling platforms known as Schahin I and Schahin III. Petrobras was expected to use the drilling platforms in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil. The rigs (drilling platforms) were to be built by Singapore\\u2019s Yantai Raffles Shipyard Company, with whom two EPC contracts were signed, at its facilities in China. EPC contract terms included performance guarantees issued by Sinosure for 10% of the contract values, liquidated damages equal to 5% of the contract values, and, according to some sources, retention payments equivalent to 15% of the contract values.  Schahin I was to be operated under a seven-year contract with Petrobras starting in 2010 and was designed to operate at depths up to 2,000m, with a drilling depth of 7,500 meters below the seabed. The contract was won in a Brazilian-only bid. The Schahin III rig received a five year contract after a bidding process open to international firms. It was designed to operate at a depth of 2,400 meters, respectively, also with a drilling depth of 7,500 meters below the seabed. Construction for both rigs was expected to take 3.5 years.  However, on December 18, 2009, Black Gold Drilling refinanced the $800 million due to delays in project implementation. The new loan had borrowing terms of LIBOR plus a 3.38% margin and a tenor of 11 years. The portion of the refinanced loan contributed by CDB is captured in project ID#59968. As with the original loan, several sources indicate additional Chinese banks participated, such as China Construction Bank or Bank of China.  While the exact start and end dates of the rigs' construction are unknown, the project was completed, and the rights to the two drilling platforms were sold to ICBC in 2014 through a sale-leaseback transaction in order to repay the loan.  Then, on July 13, 2021, a lawsuit was filed against a total of twelve banks (involved in one or both of the syndicates) by several subsidiaries of the Schahin Group. The lawsuit claimed that the banks had collaborated 'with the CEO and CFO of two Schahin Group entities [to sell] the oil rigs to ICBC below fair value when the Schahin Group was in financial distress.'   \",\"On January 25, 2018, the Chinese Ambassador to South Sudan and the South Sudanese Finance Minister signed a preferential loan framework agreement. On the same day, the Government of South Sudan and China Eximbank signed a $248.8 million loan agreement for the Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial (EPC) contract between South Sudan Civil Aviation Authority and China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) Limited, which was signed on October 14, 2016. This loan is reportedly secured by (collateralized against) airport fees/revenues that the borrower is required to deposit in a lender-controlled escrow account.  The loan's amount outstanding was $231,952,567 as of December 2022.  The purpose of the project is to construct Juba ATMS center, a new Air Traffic control tower and operation building, a surveillance system, a navigation system, and a communication system. The Juba ATMS center is located next to Juba International Airport. The project also involves the civil engineering and supporting facilities required by the equipment (such as meteorological facilities), calibration flight test training, and other forms of training for South Sudanese technicians (to prepare them for management of the air space by 2023).   CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced in June 2020 and it was originally expected to reach completion by June 2023. On July 6, 2021, South Sudan Civil Aviation Authority (SSCAA) announced the launch of a state-of-the-art online system, which allows the opening of new routes. The newly established lower airspace, launched in partnership with aviation solutions provider NavPass, is designed to boost tourism and generate revenue for the economy, according to SSCAA. Through the system, operators of commercial, cargo, and aid aircraft can integrate Juba International Airport into their routes. \\\"Through this partnership with NavPass, South Sudan will see higher volumes of aviation trade, greater business opportunities, and improved route efficiency, safety, and reliability,\\\" explained Capt. David Subek Dada, SSCAA's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He added, \\\"This marks a crucial step towards a more prosperous future for the whole of South Sudan through additional direct and indirect economic activity.\\u201d Speaking during the launch of the air traffic management system, Tom Perkins, the CEO of NavPass said the establishment of internationally compliant and globally accessible airspace was a critical and symbolic move for the country in building economic potential, connectivity, and business. \\\"For every dollar invested in sovereign airspace, capacity translates into between five and 20 dollars of economic impact. We're proud to be working with governments across the world, including South Sudan, to optimize and monetize airspace, bridging the divide between nations,\\\" he noted. Built on the global-standard Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) system, South Sudan's airspace reportedly uses an AI-powered platform to record all flights in real-time. The system automatically collects more than 99% of eligible fees, compared with the 70-80% collected by some of the world's largest economies. NavPass chief executive, Thomas Perkins, said that apart from capturing the movement of all aircraft in the country\\u2019s skies in real-time, the technology will also automate the fee collection process with proceeds invested back into the country\\u2019s air infrastructure, in line with the United Nations\\u2019 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) principles. The revenues that are collected will reportedly be transferred into an escrow account.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In March 2023, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of South Sudan to be at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on June 14, 2023, South Sudan\\u2019s National Transport Minister Madut Biar on Wednesday revealed that CHEC had halted work its work on the ATMS Project due to delays in the payment of an outstanding bill worth $36 million. He said that the Government of South Sudan had a contractual obligation to pay CHEC $6.2 million every January 21 and July 21, but this did not happen because of a failure to pay by South Sudan's Ministry of Finance.  Two weeks later, on June 27, 2023, the Chinese Government called upon the Government of South Sudan to expedite the payment of arrears for the construction of the country\\u2019s ATMS. Speaking to Radio Tamazuj during an interview, Mu Jianjun, the Economic and Commercial Counsellor in the Chinese Embassy in South Sudan, said that China Eximbank had halted the project and was waiting for the Government of South Sudan to pay the arrears for the works done before completing the construction of the country's ATMS. Mu Jianjun said \\u201c[w]e are waiting for payment from the Government of South Sudan and we suggested that the government pays as soon as possible because this project is very important for South Sudan.\\\"\",\"On December 14, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Suriname signed a $235 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [China Eximbank GCL NO (2016) 11 TOTAL NO. (581)] for the Dalian IV Road Infrastructure Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 15-year maturity, and a 5-year grace period. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Suriname and Dalian International & Technical Cooperation Group Co Ltd. (CDIG), which was signed in August 2013.   The purpose of the project was to add a layer of asphalt to 110 km of existing roads and construct or renovate four bridges. In particular, the project supported the Beekhuizen Bridge, Van Het Hogerhuysstraat Bridge, a bridge over the Saramacca Canal (Saramaccadoorsteek) near Beekhuizen as an extension of the Industrieweg-Zui, New Zanderij-Highway (also known as the 10.3 km Afobakaweg-Zanderij Highway and the Afobakaweg-Johan Adolf Pengel Airport Highway), a 42.5 km East-West connecting road to Wanhati-Tamarin, and Martin Luther Kingweg (Highway).   CDIG was the contractor responsible for implementation. The project, which was divided into two lots (Lot A and Lot B), entered implementation on October 11, 2017 and was completed on August 31, 2019.  However, there are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the Dalian IV Road Infrastructure Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. The Government of Suriname defaulted on its sovereign debt obligations three times during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2021, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that \\u2018Suriname owes arrears to China and India, which have provided assurances, although less specific than those provided by the Paris Club creditors, that they intend to work with Suriname towards a debt restructuring that will restore sustainability. China has consented to [IMF] financing notwithstanding these arrears. [...] An update will be circulated to the [IMF] Executive Board not later than one week prior to the scheduled Board consideration. On the basis of the Surinamese authorities\\u2019 commitment noted above, staff expect that debt to China and India will be treated on comparable terms with other bilateral creditors. The arrears constitute a form of financing contribution to the program. China and India have acknowledged that Suriname will continue to run arrears on their official debt until a debt treatment can be agreed.\\u2019 The IMF also disclosed in December 2021 that \\u2018[t]he stock of external arrears is estimated to be at 11 percent of GDP by end-2021, including arrears of USD 61 million to China.\\u2019 Then, in May 2023, the IMF announced the \\u2018[a]n agreement was reached with Paris Club (PC) creditors for a two-step debt treatment in June 2022, and bilateral agreements with most of the PC creditors have been completed. An agreement-in-principle with bondholders was reached on May 4, 2023. The authorities are actively negotiating in good faith with China and India on a debt restructuring agreement.\\u2019 \",\"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as \\u2018Samruk-Kazyna\\u2019). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as \\u2018Kazakhmys Corporation LLC\\u2019 and \\u2018Kazakhmys\\u2019) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC \\u2014 and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower \\u2018principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.\\u2019 As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

The scope of the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project included the construction of 22 km of highway and 18 km of access roads connected to the mining production site, the construction of 26 km of railroad, the installation of 130 km of pipelines and 500 km of cabling, the installation of fully automated Production Control Systems, the construction of a 5.5 km long Tailing Dam and related structures, the construction of various permanent buildings (measuring 39.000 m\\u00b2), and the construction of concrete, steel-prefabricated buildings.  The project sought to establish facilities able to mine 30 million tons per year. A $560 million EPC contract for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was signed between KAZ Minerals PLC and Alarko Contracting Group on September 20, 2011. China Nonferrous Metal Industry\\u2019s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was also involved in the project\\u2019s complementation. Mobilization work started in March 2012 and construction of the temporary site building and facilities were completed in the same year. Approximately 42.000 m\\u00b3 of concrete production and 5.000 tons of steel construction were completed by May 2013. The panel coating works of the process buildings started in May 2013. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on March 15, 2015.  The completion of construction activities and the commencement of commissioning works was ultimately held on September 29, 2016. The Bozymchak mine is an open-pit copper and gold mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region, Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan (exact locational coordinates: 41.2586, 71.0647). It is estimated to contain combined indicated and inferred resources of 16.5 million tons with 0.95% copper and 1.58 g/t gold. The scope of the project involved the development of the mine and its ancillary facilities. NFC was responsible for implementation. The project\\u2019s pre-feasibility study was completed in July 2008. It was originally expected to reach completion by December 2014. However, the mine was not initially commissioned until March 2014. The mine was fully commissioned and reached its commercial operations date (COD) on or around August 5, 2015. The Bozymchak mine restarted operations on December 26, 2020 after a temporary suspension that began on October 7, 2020, following political instability in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Abyz copper mine and the Nurkazgan copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 50.16861, 73.00333). Stripping works at Abyz mine commenced in January 2014. At that time, it was expected that the mine would recommence production in Q3 of 2014. The Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Akbastau-Kosmurun copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 48.60611,77.78861 and 48.6437, 77.7102). The project commenced on January 30, 2009. Its completion date is unknown. The Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Zhomart copper mine, which exploits the 14 km long Zhaman-Aybat orefield deposits that are located approximately 160 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The first stage of the mine\\u2019s development was commissioned in 2006 with a planned capacity of around 4 million tons of ore a year. The second phase of the project was schedule for implementation from 2012 to 2017 with a production start in 2018. The de facto completion date of the $300 million loan that Samruk-Kazyna contracted for an unspecified purpose was January 2013 (when it was fully repaid).\",\"The purpose of the Extension of Southern Expressway Project (ESEP) was to enhance the efficiency of the transport system by linking the country's major economic centers with Colombo City and other parts of the country. It was also designed to facilitate the activities of the Hambantota International Development Hub Project. It involves a 96 km extension of the Southern Expressway from Matara to Hambantota, and it consists of 4 sections.  ESEP Section 1 consists of the construction of a 30 km length road section from Matara to Beliatta.

Project ID#38337 captures the PBC for Section 1.  Project ID#53526 captures the PBC for Section 2. Project ID#33488 captures the GCL for Section 3.  Project ID#53522 captures the GCL for Section 4.    Section 1 was implemented by four Chinese firms \\u2014 AVIC International Engineering Corporation (a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corporation of China), China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC or 'China State Construction\\u2019), China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC), and China Railway First Survey and Design Institute Group. It commenced on January 16, 2016 and it was completed on January 19, 2019.  Section 2, which was implemented by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), commenced on October 28, 2016. Its target completion date was October 27, 2019, and as of December 31, 2018, it was 61.23% complete. It was completed on February 23, 2020. Section 3, which was implemented by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), commenced on January 25, 2016, and as of December 31, 2018, it was 88.77% complete. Its original target completion date was January 24, 2018, but this section ran behind schedule due to soil issues and delays in possession of the site. It was completed on February 23, 2020. Section 4, which was implemented by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC), commenced on January 19, 2016. Its target completion date is May 28, 2019, and as of December 31, 2018, it was 86.06% complete.  Sections 1-4 were complete, and the Southern Expressway opened to traffic on February 23, 2020. The completion of the ESEP project has successfully linked Hambantota Port and Mattala Rajapaksa Hambantota Airport.   However, this project has also encountered debt repayment problems.  On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.\",\"On April 20, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) and UEP Wind Power Pvt. Ltd signed a $252 million loan agreement for the 100 MW Jhimpir Wind Farm Project. UEP Wind Power Pvt. Ltd (UEP Wind) is a project company (special purpose vehicle) and a joint venture of Orient Group Investment Holdings Co. Ltd (99% ownership stake) and United Energy Group (1% ownership stake). The 99 MW Jhimpir Wind Project was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) basis. It was reportedly financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Based on UEP Wind\\u2019s tariff application to Pakistan\\u2019s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the estimated terms of the CDB loan are as follows: 10 year maturity, 2 year grace period, and 5.45% interest rate.   The construction of the United Energy Pakistan (UEP) wind farm involved the installation of 66 wind turbine generators (WTGs), each of which generates 1.5 MW of electricity. The project also involved the construction of a 132KV substation and a control center. China Gezhouba Group Company Limited was the Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) contractor for the project. Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd, the largest manufacturer of wind turbines in China, supplied the WTGs. The project site is located at Jhimpir in Thatta district and Sindh province. The 3200 acres of land was provided to the project company (UEP Wind) by the Government of Sindh. The groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on April 20, 2015. It achieved its commercial operation date (COD) on June 15, 2017.   The electricity from the UEP Wind Farm is supplied to the Hyderabad Electrical Supply Company grid station in Jhimpir. The per unit rate is fixed at USD 0.1352 and thus higher than the rate from the Dawood Wind Power Project, the first China-backed wind farm in Pakistan (USD 0.1187/kWh) but lower than the rate of the Sachal Wind Farm (USD 0.1486/kWh). The 99 MW Jhimpir Wind Project reportedly hired 850 local Pakistani staff and the EPC contractor paid RS. 152,598,971.00 tax to the Pakistan government, while also undertaking a series of corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects in the community, including the construction of a well for the local village as well as the donation of books to local schools.   However, this project has encountered a number of debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to UEP Wind. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 4.3 billion (approximately $21.5 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without \\u2018early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017\\u2019. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called \\u2018discos\\u2019). However, \\u2018due to various technical and financial constraints\\u2019, the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan\\u2019s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open \\u2018an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved\\u2019. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance\\u2019s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this \\u201c[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs\\u2019. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country\\u2019s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).\",\"On March 27, 2002, China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC, \\u4e2d\\u56fd\\u673a\\u68b0\\u8bbe\\u5907\\u5de5\\u7a0b\\u80a1\\u4efd\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8) signed a $114.89 million supplier credit agreement with the Government of Nigeria for Phase 1 of the Omotosho Power Plant Project. This loan carried the following terms: 12 year maturity, 6 year grace period, and 6% interest rate. It was reportedly collateralized with the proceeds from oil sales. In order to finance its supplier credit agreement with the Government of Nigeria, CMEC secured an export seller\\u2019s credit from China Eximbank that covered approximately 65% of the total cost ($170 million) of the project.   Phase 1 of 335MW Omotosho Power Plant Project involved the construction of a 335MW gas-fired power plant in Omotosho within Ondo State. Construction began in March 2005. Then, on November 10, 2006, a project company (special purpose vehicle) called Omotosho Power Plc was established to manage the power plant. On April 17, 2007, the power plant was officially commissioned, adding 335 MW of electricity to the national grid.   It was originally envisaged that, upon completion, the power project would operate commercially and the proceeds from the sales of electricity would be used for the repayment of the supplier credit. However, implementation delays, gas supply limitations, and insufficient funding at the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) resulted in an accumulation of unpaid invoices to CMEC. The Government of Nigeria eventually defaulted on its repayment obligations under the supplier credit agreement. Nigeria\\u2019s Debt Management Office (DMO) later assumed responsibility for these obligations.   In 2013, Nigeria\\u2019s National Council on Privatisation (NCP) approved a debt-to-equity swap in which CMEC-Pacific would pay $217.5 million for the power plant and the Government of Nigeria would transfer ownership of Omotosho Power Plc to CMEC-Pacific. The DMO then reported in 2014 that it had fully repaid its outstanding obligations to CMEC. \",\"On March 27, 2002, Nigeria\\u2019s Federal Ministry of Power and Steel awarded an EPC contract to SEPCO III for Phase 1 of the 335MW Papalanto Gas-fired Turbine Power Plant Project. On the same day, Shandong No. 3 Electric Power Construction Corporation (SEPCO III) signed a $114.89 million supplier credit agreement with the Government of Nigeria for Phase 1 of the Papalanto Gas-fired Turbine Power Plant Project. The  loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 12 year maturity, a 6 year grace period, and a 6% interest rate. It was reportedly collateralized with the proceeds from oil sales. In order to finance its supplier credit agreement with the Government of Nigeria, SEPCO III secured an export seller\\u2019s credit from China Eximbank that covered approximately 65% of the total cost of the project.   Phase 1 of Papalanto Gas-fired Turbine Power Plant Project involved the construction of a 8\\u00d741.87 MW gas turbine power power plant in Abeokuta within Ogun State (coordinates: 6\\u00b0 53' 51\\\" N 3\\u00b0 12' 25.5600\\\" E). Construction began on September 27, 2004. A project company (special purpose vehicle) called Olorunsogo Power Plc was later established to manage the power plant. Then, on May 27, 2007, the power plant was officially commissioned and began adding electricity to the national grid. On March 26, 2008, all eight units of the Papalanto Power Station completed trial operations and began generating electricity.   It was originally envisaged that, upon completion, the power project would operate commercially and the proceeds from the sales of electricity would be used for the repayment of the supplier credit. However, implementation delays, gas supply limitations, and insufficient funding at the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) resulted in an accumulation of unpaid invoices to SEPCO III. The Government of Nigeria eventually defaulted on its repayment obligations under the supplier credit agreement. However, Nigeria\\u2019s Debt Management Office (DMO) later assumed responsibility for these obligations in 2010. Nigeria\\u2019s National Council on Privatisation (NCP) later approved a debt-for-equity swap in which SEPCO-Pacific Partners provided an equity contribution for the power plant and the Government of Nigeria would transfer ownership of Olorunsogo Power Plc to SEPCO-Pacific Partners. \",\"On June 20, 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China ('China Eximbank') and the Government of Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance signed a financing agreement for the Songo Songo to Dar Es Salaam Gas Pipeline and Natural Gas Processing Plants at Mnazi Bay and Songo Songo Project. Two loans were issued to Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance: a $275 million buyer's credit loan (BCL) with an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 430 basis points, a 1.83-year (22 month) grace period, and a 12.83-year (154 month) maturity and a $920 million preferential\\u2019s buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) with a 20-year maturity, a 7-year (84 month) grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The PBC (captured via Project ID#59752) was scheduled for semi-annual repayment every January 21 and July 21. It had a grace period of 84 months from the first loan disbursement date (June 20, 2013) and it was scheduled to be repaid in full 156 months from the end of the grace period. The BCL (captured via Project ID#59733) was scheduled for semi-annual repayment every January 21 and July 21. It had a grace period of 22 months from the first loan disbursement date (July 24, 2013) and it was scheduled to be repaid in full 132 months from the end of the grace period.  The PBC and BCL proceeds were on-lent from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance to the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), which in turn used the proceeds to finance a September 2011 commercial (EPC) contract with China Petroleum Technology and Development Corporation (CPTDC), a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company (CNPC).  The PBC and BCL were both secured with (i.e. collateralized against) all rights under a natural gas sales agreement between the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) and TPDC. The borrower (Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance) and end-user (TPDC) was required to deposit profits from the gas pipeline into three Stanbic Bank escrow accounts that were accessible to the lender. According to TPDC\\u2019s audited financial statements, the escrow accounts \\u2018were opened to secure repayment of principal and payment of interest and fees under the loan agreements\\u2019 and the minimum cash balances in these accounts functioned as sources of \\u2018collateral\\u2019. TPDC and Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance maintained a cash balance of TZS 42,011,517,702 in the escrow accounts as of June 30, 2014, TZS 120,509,276,347 as of June 30, 2015 (TZS 2,380,765,097 from TPDC and TZS 118,128,511,250 from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance), $60,340,466 (TZS 131,473,427,000) as of June 30, 2016 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance), $60,340,466 as of June 30, 2017, $60,320,710 (TZS 136,713,000,000) as of June 30, 2018, $60,320,710 (TZS 138,105,000,000) as of June 30, 2019 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance), $60,320,710 (TZS 138,527,000,000) as of June 30, 2020 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance), and $60,320,710 (TZS 138,673,000,000) as of June 30, 2021 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance). China Eximbank conducted a small \\u2018cash sweep\\u2019 (worth $19,806) from one of the escrow accounts between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018. It withdrew these funds \\u2018as a penalty for [the Government of Tanzania\\u2019s] late repayment of due installment.\\u2019  The first PBC disbursement took place on June 20, 2013. The first BCL disbursement took place on July 24, 2013. Another loan disbursement (worth $126,495,423.10) took place in August 2014. The proceeds of the BCL and PBC were earmarked for the following sub-projects: (a) $151,735,000 for the Songo Songo Natural Gas Plant; (b) $197,877,000 for the Mnazi Bay Natural Gas Plant; and (c) $875,715,000 for the Natural Gas Pipeline.  The PBC\\u2019s outstanding amount was TZS 353,208,000,000 as of July 1, 2013, TZS 929,156,000,000 as of June 30, 2014, TZS 1,689,444,000,000 as of June 30, 2015, TZS 2,075,037,000,000 as of June 30, 2016, TZS 2,180,592,000,000 as of June 30, 2017, TZS 2,261,433,000,000 as of June 30, 2018, TZS 2,330,382,000,000 as of June 30, 2019, TZS 2,382,841,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, and TZS 2,428,269,000,000 as of June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2016, TPDC disclosed in an audited financial statement that it had defaulted on its repayment obligations under the PBC because it had not made an interest payments to the Government of Tanzania.  As of June 30, 2021, TPDC disclosed in an audited financial statement that it had not made any principal or interest payments on the PBC to the Government of Tanzania (despite the fact that the PBC\\u2019s grace period expired on June 20, 2020).

As of June 30, 2016, TPDC disclosed in an audited financial statement that it had defaulted on its repayment obligations under the BCL because it had not made an interest payments to the Government of Tanzania. As of June 30, 2021, TPDC disclosed in an audited financial statement that it had not made any principal or interest payments on the BCL to the Government of Tanzania (despite the fact that the BCL\\u2019s grace period expired on May 24, 2015).  The gas pipeline project was designed and constructed to deliver natural gas to Dar es Salaam for use in power generation, industrial applications, household cooking and in propulsion of transport vehicles. It involved the construction of a 542 kilometer marine and terrestrial pipeline between Songo Songo and Dar Es Salaam as well as two processing plants: one in Songo Songo and another in Mnazi Bay.   The 542-kilometer gas pipeline has four parts: (i) 290-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Madimba in Mtwara to Somanga Fungu; (ii) 25-kilometer marine pipeline of 24-inches from Songo Songo Island to Somanga Fungu; (iii) 197-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Somanga Fungu to Kinyerezi in Dar es Salaam; and (iv) 30-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 16-inches diameter from Kinyerezi to Tegeta in Dar es Salaam. It passes through 1 marine park, 4 regions, 8 districts, 41 wards and 113 villages. The capacity of the main (36 inch) pipeline is rated at 784 million standard cubic feet per day, according to the Natural Gas Utilization Master Plan 2016-2045, but can handle up to 1002 million standard cubic feet per day with compression. It is the longest gas pipeline that has ever been constructed in Tanzania.  CPTDC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction was officially launched on November 8, 2012 and the Tanzanian President inaugurated the constructed pipeline on October 10, 2015. The pipeline was originally scheduled for a completion date in 2014.   Loan repayment was originally expected to depend on gas sales upon completion of the pipeline construction and after the project's commercial operation date (COD). However, a review of the on-lending agreements, Gas Sales Agreements (GSA), and pipeline construction contract revealed that the pipeline was constructed before pre-identification and pre-signing of gas sales agreements between Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and its expected major gas customers. This anomaly had an effect on loan repayment as actual gas sales came in far below the initial projection of 138.8 million standard cubic feet per day. In fact, according to a report published by the Government of Tanzania's Controller and Auditor General (CAG), TANESCO was the only gas consumer as of March 2017 -- with a consumption average of 46.61 million standard cubic feet per day instead of the agreed amount of at least 80 million standard cubic feet per day as per the GSA between TPDC and TANESCO.  There are also indications that the China Eximbank loans that were issued for the Songo Songo to Dar Es Salaam Gas Pipeline and Natural Gas Processing Plants at Mnazi Bay and Songo Songo Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives and the original expectations of the lender. Tanzania's National Audit Office (NAO) warned of 'Financial Distress Facing TPDC Due to Non-Settlement of TANESCO Long Outstanding Bills TZS 248 Billion' in its Annual General Report on the Audit of Public Authorities and other Bodies for the financial year 2016/2017. More specifically, the NAO noted that 'TPDC and TANESCO entered into a Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) in September 2015 whereby the TANESCO buys natural gas from TPDC for power generation at Kinyerezi, Ubungo II and Symbion Power Plants. I have noted that between September 2015 and December 2017 monthly invoices totaling to TZS 567,514,961,312.95. (USD 254,448,796.08), were issued by TPDC to TANESCO with respects to the natural gas supplied to TANESCO for power generation. My audit noted that by December 2017, TANESCO had managed to settle TZS 318,904,743,618.61 (USD 142,982,887.87) equivalent to 56% of the total amount of invoices leaving TZS 248,610,217,694.34 (USD 111,465,908.21) unsettled. TPDC may not be able to service the loan obtained to facilitate construction of Mtwara-Dar Gas Pipeline from EXIM Bank of China and their respective interests, if TANESCO does not settle this liability. Failure to repay the loan shall subject the Corporation to a compounded interest of 0.8% charged on the unpaid loan balance which will increase financial cost to TPDC and the Government. Further, failure to pay the loan shall amount to transfer of TPDC rights under the Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) to EXIM Bank of China as per Clause 2 of the Security Assignment Contractual Rights which forms of the Agreement signed between TPDC and EXIM Bank of China. The Government through Ministry of Finance and Planning and Ministry of Energy should consider assisting TANESCO in their efforts to settle such long outstanding dues which in turn will help TPDC meet gas purchase and other operational costs.' TPDC\\u2019s audited financial statements also indicate that, as the ultimate borrower/end user, it had fallen into arrears by 2017/2018. TPDC\\u2019s audited financial statements for the year ending on June 30, 2018 note that China Eximbank withdrew $19,806 from one of the escrow accounts between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 as a penalty for the borrower\\u2019s \\u2018late repayment of [a] due installment\\u2019. Then, in June 2019, TPDC announced that it was still having difficulty servicing its debts to the Government of Tanzania and it began to lobby for \\u2018debt relief\\u2019 \\u2014 that is, for the Government of Tanzania to shoulder the responsibility of loan repayment instead of TPDC.\",\"On December 27, 2016, the Ethiopian Government and China Eximbank signed a $249,323,075.34 (ETB 5,608,008,042) preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the Genale Dawa III-Yirga Alem II-Wolayita Sodo II-Hawassa II Power Transmission Project. The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement on February 7, 2017 under Proclamation No. 1000/2017. The proclamation went into effect on February 22. 2017.  The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 12 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and a 2.43% interest rate. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to partially finance a commercial (EPC) contract between Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo), China Energy Engineering Corporation Limited (CEEC), and Xinjiang Electric Power Design Institute, which was signed in September 2014 and modified on August 22, 2015.   China Eximbank made 8 loan disbursements (worth $212,287,364.45 or ETB 5,650,372,288) between 2017 and 2019: a $124,304,105.62 disbursement on July 20, 2017, a $30,530,211.81 disbursement on August 18, 2017, a $23,090,272.81 disbursement on November 23, 2017, a $7,237,606.93 disbursement on December 8, 2017, a $4,070,685.80 disbursement on December 18, 2017, a $11,054,217.02 disbursement on June 14, 2018, a $3,806,431.81 disbursement on August 3, 2018, and a $8,193,832.65 disbursement on September 11, 2019.   The project involved the construction of a 355 km, 400kV transmission line from the Genale Dawa III substation to the Yirga Alem II substation and the Wolayita Sodo II substation and Hawassa II substation. $195 million of the loan proceeds was earmarked for construction of the transmission line, while the remaining $54 million was earmarked for construction of the substations.   Xinjiang Electric Power Design Institute and CEEC were the general EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. Sichuan Electric Power Transmission and Transformation Construction Co., Ltd. was also involved (most likely as a subcontractor).  Construction began in November 2015 and the project was completed on May 5, 2017.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Genale Dawa III-Yirga Alem II-Wolayita Sodo II-Hawassa II Power Transmission Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"In October 2008, a contract for the construction and launch of Paksat-1R, a DFH-4-type satellite, was signed between Pakistan's Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC). The communication satellite was to be constructed with 30 year transponders, 12 in C-Band and 18 in Ku-Band, each of 36 MHz Bandwidth. Then, in September 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a framework agreement (captured via Project ID#72713). Under the terms of the framework agreement, China Eximbank agreed to provide up to RMB 1.385 billion for the Paksat-1R Project. Any subsidiary loans under this framework agreement would bear the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.2% commitment fee, and a 0.2% management fee.   Shortly thereafter, on October 15, 2009, Deputy Director of the China Eximbank and the Pakistani Ambassador to China signed a RMB 1,350,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2009) 16 TOTAL NO. (267)] for the Paksat-1R Satellite System Project (captured via Project ID#43298). China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan also signed an RMB 86.5 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2010) 33 TOTAL NO. (330)] for the construction of a ground control facility on October 27, 2010 (as captured via Project ID#36953). The proceeds of the GCLs were on-lent from the Government of Pakistan to the National Space Agency of Pakistan (SUPARCO) at a 15% interest rate.  Paksat-1R, a DFH-4-type satellite, was constructed by the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and the China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC). On August 12, 2011, at the Chinese Xichang Satellite Launch Center, Pakistan\\u2019s first Communications Satellite PAKSAT-1R, as part of Pakistan\\u2019s Space Programme 2040, was launched. The launch was witnessed by Pakistani Secretary Defence Lt Gen Syed Athar Ali (R), Secretary Foreign Affairs, Salman Bashir, Director General, Strategic Plans Division Lt Gen Khalid Ahmed Kidwai (R) and Ambassador of Pakistan to China, Muhammad Masood Khan. Launched on the Long March 3B rocket, the Paksat-1R satellite has a design life of 15 years with initial goals to provide broadband internet access, digital television broadcasting, remote and rural telephony, emergency communications, tele-education and tele-medicine services across South and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, East Africa and the Far East. The satellite successfully took over the operations of its predecessor, the PakSat-1E satellite leased by Pakistan, in geostationary orbit at 38\\u00b0 East.  The commercial services of the satellite were inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan on November 5, 2011 from the satellite ground station located near Lahore. On November 11, 2011, the ground control center was transferred to the Pakistani side for its use.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank government concessional loans for the Paksat-1R Satellite System Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. in 2020, reports emerged SUPARCO was unable to repay the China Eximbank loans for the RSSS Project. SUPARCO sought relief from a panel consisting of the Federal Minister of Planning, Development & Special Initiatives, the Federal Minister for Industries & Production, and the Advisor to PM on Finance and Revenue on October 12, 2020. The panel viewed SUPARCO\\u2019s case favorably and recommended that it be approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC). At that time, it was proposed that SUPARCO be allowed to repay the loans at a 2% rather than a 15% interest rate. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the government concessional loan agreements for the Paksat-1R Satellite System Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-030]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the government concessional loan agreements for the Paksat-1R Satellite System Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the government concessional loan agreements for the Paksat-1R Satellite System Project.

The PBC loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 5 year grace period.   According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $189,999,717.85) took place on July 1, 2013 and the second and final loan disbursement (of $10,000,000) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that, as of 2014, had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($199,999,717.85 out of $199,999,703). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 10% as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $114,486,759.69 as of December 31, 2021.  This project sought to upgrade rehabilitate a 223 km stretch along the Bishkek\\u2013Naryn\\u2013Torugart Road between kilometer 9 to kilometer 272 (9km-272km). The Bishkek-Naryn-Torugart road is one of the main transport routes within Kyrgyzstan and comprises part of \\\"Europe-East Asia\\\" CAREC Transport Corridor.   China Road and Bridge Corporation was the contractor responsible for project implementation. A \\u201cnotice to commence\\u201d was issued to the contractor on May 1, 2010. Section 1 (from kilometer 9 to km 103) was completed on December 31, 2012.    However, there are some indications that the preferential buyer's credit for the Section 1 of Bishkek\\u2013Naryn\\u2013Torugart Road Rehabilitation Project (9km-272km) financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029]. Under the terms of the agreement (captured via Project ID#96102), the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for the Section 1 of Bishkek\\u2013Naryn\\u2013Torugart Road Rehabilitation Project (9km-272km).\",\"On August 30, 2005, China Eximbank signed a $300 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka for Phase I of the Puttalam/Norochcholai Coal Power Project. The PBC (captured via Project ID#33244) carries a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and an interest rate of 2%. It had disbursed $142,821,238.39 as of December 31, 2007 (Rs. 15,792,886,899) and $168,963,610.51 as of December 31, 2008 (Rs. 18,303,490,000). The borrower made repayments worth $19,978,236.69 in 2014 (Rs. 2,608,894,000). The PBC\\u2019s amount outstanding was $270,343,633.50 (Rs. 35,303,310,000) as of December 31, 2013, $210,000,000 as of December 31, 2016, and $100,000,000 as of June 30, 2022. On September 8, 2006, China Eximbank signed a $152,982,428 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) with the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka for the Phase I of Puttalam/Norochcholai Coal Power Project. The BCL (captured via Project ID#33463) carries a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 6% interest rate. The BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $3,960,517.11 (Rs. 517,191,257) as of December 31, 2013, $130,035,063 as of December 31, 2016, and $45,894,728 as of June 30, 2022.  The Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka then used the proceeds from the BCL and PBC to on-lend to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is a state-owned electricity company that controls all major functions of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing in Sri Lanka. This project involved the installation of a 300MW coal power plant, a jetty for coal handling, and transmission lines from Norochcholai to Veyangoda and substation at Veyangoda. China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. A project inauguration ceremony took place on May 11, 2006. Phase I construction began on July 23, 2007. The first 300-megawatt phase was completed and ceremonially commissioned by President Mahinda Rajapaksa on March 22, 2011.   However, there are indications that project has encountered debt repayment problems. In 2021, CEB disclosed that the Sri Lankan Treasury had \\u2018take[n] over [its] repayment obligation[s] due to non-availability of appropriate income based on the tariff approved by [Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka]. Then on April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.\",\"On December 23, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $259 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO.

The proceeds of the PBC and the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Pakistan's National Highway Authority (NHA) and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on December 21, 2010.   The project had a total length of 24 kilometers and involved the realignment of a portion of the highway that was submerged under water during the Attabad landslide in 2010.  It involved the realignment of roads, construction of 5 tunnels with total length of 7.12 km, 78 culverts and 2 bridges (471.8 meters).   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 26, 2012 and the project was completed on September 14, 2015.

The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96247. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.\",\"On July 29, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed a $3 billion oil-backed master framework agreement (or line of credit) to finance various infrastructure projects (see Umbrella Project ID#57039). This resources-credit cooperation package is backed by future revenues from the sale of oil exports. Each subsidiary buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) issued through the framework agreement carries a 15-year maturity and 5.6% interest rate.  On April 4, 2010, China Eximbank reportedly agreed in principle to finance a $274 million South Kordofan 220kV Power Transmission and Distribution Project through this non-concessional master framework agreement. However, on October 8, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed a $233 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for this project, which carried a different set of concessional borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity and 3% interest rate. The proceeds from this PBC were used to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $274 million commercial contract between China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) and the National Electricity Corporation (NEC) of Sudan, which was signed on July 4, 2009.  The project involved the construction of an electricity transmission line than runs from the city of El-Obeid (in central Sudan within North Kordofan State) to a power plant in Al-Fulah (or al-Fula or EI Fula or \\u0627\\u0644\\u0641\\u0648\\u0644\\u0629) in West Kordofan State. The 405 MW Al-Fulah Gas-Fired Power Plant Construction Project was funded through a separate China Eximbank BCL (as captured via Project ID#1007). The ultimate goal was to supply power to Northern and Southern Kordofan and the western region of Darfur.   This project did reach the implementation phase, but it is unclear whether or when the project was completed.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the South Kordofan 220kV Power Transmission and Distribution Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. According to Sudan\\u2019s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022.\",\"On October 1, 2013, China Development Bank and Ethiopian Sugar Corporation (ESC) \\u2014 an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise \\u2014 signed a $290 million (ETB 5,482,041.588) buyer's credit (loan) agreement for the Omo Kuraz 2 Sugar Factory Construction Project (captured via Project ID#58656). The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.6% margin, a grace period of 3 years, and a maturity of 13 years. The Government of Ethiopia provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan. Sinosure provided buyer\\u2019s credit insurance. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a $682 million commercial (EPC) contract that it signed in March 2013 with China National Complete Plant Import Export Corporation (COMPLANT) for the construction of the Omo Kuraz 2 sugar factory and Omo Kuraz 3 sugar factory.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $290 million (ETB 5,482,041.588) loan for the Omo Kuraz 2 Sugar Factory Construction Project achieved a 120% disbursement rate, with China Development Bank making 19 loan disbursements (worth ETB 6,554,551.271) between 2014 and 2018: an ETB 1,145,280,176 disbursement on May 29, 2014, an ETB 449,017,120 disbursement on March 6, 2015, an ETB 261,364,209 disbursement on November 3, 2015, an ETB 285,352,353 disbursement on December 23, 2015, an ETB 122,759,215 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 815,954,636 disbursement on September 26, 2016, an ETB 549,281,319 disbursement on September 26, 2016, an ETB 133,426,866 disbursement on October 24, 2016, an ETB 147,108,527 disbursement on October 24, 2016, an ETB 241,605,770 disbursement on February 15, 2017, an ETB 67,915,564 disbursement on February 24, 2017, an ETB 149,759,299 disbursement on February 24, 2017, an ETB 228,357,488 disbursement on September 25, 2017, an ETB 132,889,199 disbursement on September 25, 2017, an ETB 117,929,128 disbursement on September 25, 2017, an ETB 77,856,763 disbursement on November 28, 2017, an ETB 635,784,607 disbursement on January 3, 2018, an ETB 77,305,249 disbursement on April 13, 2018, and an ETB 915,603,784  disbursement on May 24, 2018. According to the AMP, the CDB loan was restructured on an unspecified date to reduce the amount that the borrower would be responsible for repaying by 50% over a 5-year period. This loan rescheduling is captured via Project ID#92357.   The purpose of the project was to construct the Omo Kuraz 2 Sugar Factory in South Omo within South Nations Nationalities and Peoples Regional State (SNNPRS). The precise locational coordinates of the factory are 5.90692, 36.03851. Upon completion, the factory was expected to crush 6,000 to 12,000 tons of sugar cane a day. The factory was also expected to generate 60MW of electricity and send 40MW of electricity to the national power grid (as the sugar factory only requires 20MW).   COMPLANT was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began in July 2014. Then, on December 3, 2016, a training course was completed for local employees on the operations and maintenance of the sugar factory. Two weeks later, on December 18, 2016, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia conducted an on-site project inspection. As of the end of the fiscal year 2016/17, the project had achieved a 94.5% completion rate but it was running behind schedule. The sugar factory began trial production activities on March 27, 2017. It went into full production on December 31, 2017. However, in October 2019, Ethiopia's Auditor-General Gemechu Dubiso announced that he was investigating the possibility that funds earmarked by ESC for ten state-owned sugar factories (potentially including the Omo Kuraz 2 Sugar Factory) were stolen or misappropriated. Then, in July 2021, the Government of Ethiopia announced that it would privatize the Omo Kuraz 2 sugar factory due to debt sustainability problems and the inability of the ESC to fund the operations of the faltering sugar factory and several others.\",\"The purpose of the Extension of Southern Expressway Project (ESEP) was to enhance the efficiency of the transport system by linking the country's major economic centers with Colombo City and other parts of the country. It was also designed to facilitate the activities of the Hambantota International Development Hub Project. It involves a 96 km extension of the Southern Expressway from Matara to Hambantota, and it consists of 4 sections.   ESEP Section 1 consists of the construction of a 30 km length road section from Matara to Beliatta. ESEP Section 2 consists of the construction of a 26 km length road section from Beliatta to Wetiya. The scope of this project includes the construction of 2 interchanges, 26 underpasses, 7 overpasses, 8 bridges, and 70 box culverts. ESEP Section 3 consists of the construction of a 15 km length road section from Wetiya to Andarawewa. The scope of this project includes the construction of 1 viaduct, 18 underpasses, 5 overpasses, 2 bridges, 45 box culverts, and 6 pipe culverts. This project also includes the construction of the Ranna-Wetiya Road (HR 21) and Sooriyawewa-Galwewa Junction-Embilipitiya Road (HR 06, HR 10). ESEP Section 4 consists of the construction of a 25 km length road section from Mattala to Hambantota via Andarawewa. The scope of this project includes the construction of 2 viaducts, 1 interchange, 6 bridges, 2 bridge underpasses, 2 overpasses, 10 culvert underpasses, 61 box culverts, and 1 aqueduct.   China Eximbank financed each of these sections of ESEP with four different loans. On December 23, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $683.5 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [PBC No. (2014) 27 Total No. (321)] for Section 1 (Matara to Beliatta) of ESEP. The face value of the PBC was subsequently downsized to $663,982,749.

Section 4, which was implemented by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC), commenced on January 19, 2016. Its target completion date is May 28, 2019, and as of December 31, 2018, it was 86.06% complete. Sections 1-4 were complete, and the Southern Expressway opened to traffic on February 23, 2020. The completion of the ESEP project has successfully linked Hambantota Port and Mattala Rajapaksa Hambantota Airport.   However, this project has also encountered debt repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.\",\"On March 27, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development signed a $293,250,000 (ETB 5,420,517,560) preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement for the 153MW Adama Wind Farm II Project. Then, on June 11, 2013, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under proclamation no. 795/2013. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, an 8 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development subsequently signed an on-lending agreement with Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO). The ultimate borrower (EEPCO) was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $340 million commercial (EPC) contract between EEPCO and Hydrochina-CGCOC JV, which was signed on October 11, 2012.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $293,250,000 (ETB 5,420,517,560) loan (PBC) achieved a 123% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 10 loan disbursements (worth ETB 6,659,539,738) between 2013 and 2016: an ETB 1,306,818,182 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 517,241,379 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 1,712,598,425 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 343,434,343 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 142,992,012 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 184,297,042 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 445,179,744 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 741,377,956 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 524,222,698 disbursement on January 7, 2016, and an ETB 741,377,956 disbursement on October 7, 2016. The purpose of the project was to install a 153MW wind farm with 102 turbines near the city of Adama in a range of rocky hills in the Ethiopian highlands 100 kilometers southeast of the capital Addis Ababa. The project also involved the construction of 10 km worth of electricity transmission lines to connect the wind farm to the 230kv grid via the Koka substation.   Hydrochina-CGCOC JV \\u2014 a joint venture between Hydrochina Corporation, and CGC Overseas Construction Co. Ltd. (CGCOC) \\u2014 was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Upon completion, it was expected that the Adama II Wind Farm would be able to generate about 476 million kWh electricity every year, thereby meeting over 20% of the electricity needs of the capital city of Ethiopia.  It was also expected that by substituting oil power plants of the same scale, the Adama I Wind Farm and Adama II Wind Farm could together save 160,000 tons of fuel oil and reduce almost 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Hydrochina Corporation was responsible for the project\\u2019s feasibility study. CGCOC was responsible for the project\\u2019s mechanical work. Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. \\u2014 another Chinese company \\u2014 was responsible for the provision of the wind turbines. Construction started in June 2013. During the construction phase, in order to avoid dust and sand, water was sprayed on the excavated earth.  In order to minimize the impact of traffic noise and dust brought by vehicle transportation during construction, Hydrochina-CGCOC JV strictly controlled and managed the driving times and routes. Speed bumps were set up on a windy road to reduce dust blown by fast-driving vehicles. Trees, flowers and plants were grown around the booster stations. Hydrochina-CGCOC JV also built stone drainage and afforested slopes near the assembly site of wind turbines, thereby preventing soil erosion. Local floral and fauna species were reportedly protected. An official inauguration ceremony for the Adama Wind Farm II (Adama II Wind Farm) took place on May 18, 2015. The wind farm was then transferred to the project owner (EEPCO) and put into operation in June 2016. The 153MW Adama Wind Farm II Project reportedly created thousands of jobs for local people during the construction phase and continued to provide hundreds of jobs for local people during the operation phase.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Adama Wind Farm II Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On March 11, 2014, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $300 million loan facility agreement [No. 4510201401100000245] for the Rehabilitation and Improvement of Priority Road Project 3 - Phase I (PRP3-I). This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin, a 0.5% management fee, and a 5% Sinosure insurance (risk) premium.  The loan was apparently secured by (i.e. collateralized against) cash deposits in an escrow account.

The loan's amount outstanding was $227,255,064 as of December 31, 2017, $221,140,506 as of December 31, 2018, $209,026,757 as of December 31, 2019, $194,065,682 as of December 31, 2020, $184,499,508 as of December 31, 2021, and $172,949,508 as of June 30, 2022.   By early 2022, it was clear that the loan was non-performing. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Development Bank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement. By March 2023, the Government of Sri Lanka had accumulated $338 million in arrears to China Development Bank.  PRP3 Phase I was divided into two parts, A and B. The contractors for PRP3-Phase I (A) were China National Aero-Technology International Engineering (CATIC - ENG) and Xi'an Dagang Machinery Co. Ltd. The contractors for PRP3-Phase I (B) were CATIC and Hunan Construction Engineering Group Corporation (Hunan). Under PRP3- Phase I (A), 6 roads were rehabilitated:  1. Ratnapura - Palawela - Karawita Road: 00.00km - 21.28 km  2. Veyangoda -Ruwanwella Road: 12.4 km - 32.2 km (19.8 km total length). This section also included the rehabilitation of a bridge.  3.

Then, on June 15, 2014, Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao and Zambian Vice President Guy Scott witnessed the signing of two Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ETCA). One committed a $32 million grant (captured via Project ID#40890) and the other committed $32 million interest-free loan (captured via Project ID#40889). Some of the funds from one or both of these ETCAs helped finance the KKIA Airport Expansion Project.  Then, on September 16, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance and National Planning signed two loan agreements for the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) Airport Expansion Project: a $306,000,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) and a $54,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement. The PBC, captured via Project ID#40893, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The GCL, captured via Project ID#92156, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.   The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $385,000,000 (or $385,809,673) commercial contract between the Government of Zambia and China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Cooperation, which was signed on June 3, 2013 and amended on September 5, 2013. As of July 2022, the PBC had achieved a 74.7% disbursement rate ($228,810,000 out of $306,000,000).  The project involves the expansion of Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in Lusaka (exact locational coordinates: -15.325266732091906, 28.448490127571315). More specifically, the project involves the construction of a new presidential pavilion, passenger terminal, commercial complex, airport shopping mall, office park, warehousing facilities, fire station, control tower, and hotel. It also included the rehabilitation of the existing terminal into a new one to carter for domestic flights.  China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation is the contractor responsible for design and works. The contract with Zambia Airports Corporation Ltd. (ZACL) came into force on March 10, 2015 and construction began on April 1, 2015.   The project was originally expected to commenced on April 21, 2015 and conclude on October 20, 2019. The expected project completion date was later revised to June 2020 and then March 10, 2022. As of July 31, 2020, the project had achieved an 89% completion rate. As of April 30, 2021, the project had achieved a 93% completion rate. As of June 30, 2021, $271,900,000 had been paid to CJIC (representing 75.53% of the EPC contract value). As of August 31, 2021, the new airport terminal building had been handed over and commissioned, but, the following works were outstanding: bullet-proofing and finishing on the presidential pavilion (89% completion rate); steel structure installation on the corridor connecting the terminals (35% completion rate); a widening of the taxiway shoulder (98% completion rate); a rehabilitation of the existing terminal building (5% completion rate); and a rehabilitation of ZASTI (10% completion rate). A formal airport opening ceremony took place on August 9, 2021.   This project has been plagued by corruption allegations and performance problems. In April 2015, media outlets reported that Zambian government officials and CJIC stole $25 million from the China Eximbank loan by unilaterally changing the original contract from $385 million to $360 million. This corruption allegation and contract renegotiations delayed project implementation by a few years. Then, in October 2019, China Eximbank reportedly halted loan disbursements due to concerns that the Government of Zambia would default on its repayment obligations.  On July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the PBC\\u2019s undisbursed balance ($77,190,000.00); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities\\u2019 request for a debt treatment under \\u2018the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI\\u2019 endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. MOFNP also announced on July 29, 2022 that it planned to finance the completion of the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) Airport Expansion Project with general government revenues, and it signaled its intention to rescope the project to focus on the construction of the old terminal building and the extension of the runway and lighting system.\",\"In March 2003, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the construction of a second nuclear power plant (Chashma II) with a 300 MW capacity at Chashma, Pakistan, where a nuclear plant (Chashma I) was already installed. Then, on August 3, 2004, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $150 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [ID# BLA 04083] for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project (or Unit 2 of CHASNUPP). The PBC, which is captured via Project ID#35108, carried the following borrowing terms: a 3% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 7 year grace period.  Then, on March 31, 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2005) 03 TOTAL NO. (125)] worth RMB 1,598,764,499.79 (or approximately $200 million) for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project (or Unit 2 of CHASNUPP). The GCL, which is captured via Project ID#35262, carried a 2% interest rate but the other borrowing terms are unknown.   The PBC had achieved a 69.5% disbursement rate ($104,390,000 out of $150,000,000) as of June 30, 2008, an 83.5% disbursement rate ($125,390,000 out of $150,000,000) as of June 30, 2009, and an 88.2% disbursement rate ($132,390,000 out of $150,000,000) as of June 30, 2010. PBC repayments amounts to $9,223,106.80 ($6,594,213.63 in principal and $2,628,893.17 in interest) from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The GCL had achieved a 62.2% disbursement rate (RMB 994,496,299.79 out of RMB 1,598,764,499.79) as of June 30, 2008, a 64.4% disbursement rate (RMB 1,095,731,800 out of RMB 1,598,764,499.79) as of June 30, 2009, and a 75.7% disbursement rate (RMB 1.287,251,299.09 out of RMB 1,598,764,499.79) as of June 30, 2010. GCL repayments amounted to $23,475,896.05 ($18,919,655.35 in principal and $4,556,240.70) from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013.   The Chashma Nuclear Power Plant (or CHASNUPP) is a large commercial nuclear power plant located in the vicinities of Chashma colony and Kundian in Punjab in Pakistan. Its exact locational coordinates are 32.390278, 71.4625. The purpose of the China Eximbank-financed project was to construct a second unit (CNP-300 reactor) at the power plant (known as C2 or CHASNUPP-II) with nominal difference of generating a gross electrical capacity of 325 MWe with a net output of about 300 MW.   China Zhongyuan Engineering Company (CZEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on April 8, 2005. The Chashma II power plant was officially inaugurated on May 10, 2011.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank preferential buyer's credit for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-033]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2020-December 2020 is captured via Project ID#96254. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96245. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.\",\"On October 24, 2017, China Power Hub Generation Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (CPHGC) signed a $1,496,000,000 syndicated loan agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks \\u2014 including China Development Bank (CDB, lead arranger), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank, co-lead arranger), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), and Bank of Communications Co. Limited (BOCOM) \\u2014 for the 2\\u00d7660MW Imported Coal Based Independent Power Generation Project at Hub. According to CPHGC's upfront tariff application to Pakistan\\u2019s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, the estimated borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are as follows: a maturity period of 14 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 450 basis points (4.5%). The borrower purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. As sources of collateral, the borrower also pledged shareholdings, assets, accounts, electricity payment receivables, and its Sinosure insurance policy.   CDB's contribution is captured via Project ID#52423. China Eximbank's contribution is captured via Project ID#92387. ICBC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92388. CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92390. BOCOM's contribution is captured via Project ID#92391.   The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $1.995 billion and it was financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. CPHGC is a project company and joint venture of China Power International Holding Ltd (CPIH) and the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO) that was established to finance, design, and implement this 1320 MW imported coal based power project. CPIH has a 74% ownership stake and HUBCO has a 26% ownership stake in CPHGC. CPHGC was granted a generation license by Pakistan\\u2019s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on September 8, 2016. The term of the license is 30 years from the date of the commencement of commercial operations. CPHGC also submitted an application for an upfront tariff determination with NEPRA, which was approved on February 12, 2016. Then, on January 25, 2017, the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) were signed.   The purpose of the project is to construct 2\\u00d7660 MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal at Hub, Mouza Kund, Tehsil Gadani, Lasbela District, and Balochistan Province. Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Co. Ltd. (NWEPDI) and Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for project design and implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its originally expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan\\u2019s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. The Government of Pakistan fell behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to CPHGC. Total payment arrears, as of May 2022, amounted to PKR 71.6 billion (approximately $379,480,000), which reportedly brought the power plant to the brink of closure and CPHGC to the brink of default. It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country\\u2019s central bank \\u2014 the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) \\u2014 had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan\\u2019s Secretary of Power and warned that \\u2018any further delay in [\\u2026] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.\\u2019 He also warned that \\u2018If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.\\u2019   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without \\u2018early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017\\u2019. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called \\u2018discos\\u2019). However, \\u2018due to various technical and financial constraints\\u2019, the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan\\u2019s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open \\u2018an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved\\u2019. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance\\u2019s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this \\u201c[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs\\u2019. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country\\u2019s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in March 2023, CPHGC warned that it was at risk of defaulting on its loan repayment obligations due to overdue power purchase payments from the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G).\",\"On October 24, 2017, China Power Hub Generation Company (Pvt.)

The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $1.995 billion and it was financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio.   CPHGC is a project company and joint venture of China Power International Holding Ltd (CPIH) and the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO) that was established to finance, design, and implement this 1320 MW imported coal based power project. CPIH has a 74% ownership stake and HUBCO has a 26% ownership stake in CPHGC. CPHGC was granted a generation license by Pakistan\\u2019s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on September 8, 2016. The term of the license is 30 years from the date of the commencement of commercial operations. CPHGC also submitted an application for an upfront tariff determination with NEPRA, which was approved on February 12, 2016. Then, on January 25, 2017, the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) were signed.   The purpose of the project is to construct 2\\u00d7660 MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal at Hub, Mouza Kund, Tehsil Gadani, Lasbela District, and Balochistan Province. Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Co. Ltd. (NWEPDI) and Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for project design and implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its originally expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan\\u2019s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. The Government of Pakistan fell behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to CPHGC. Total payment arrears, as of May 2022, amounted to PKR 71.6 billion (approximately $379,480,000), which reportedly brought the power plant to the brink of closure and CPHGC to the brink of default. It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country\\u2019s central bank \\u2014 the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) \\u2014 had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan\\u2019s Secretary of Power and warned that \\u2018any further delay in [\\u2026] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.\\u2019 He also warned that \\u2018If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.\\u2019   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without \\u2018early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017\\u2019. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called \\u2018discos\\u2019). However, \\u2018due to various technical and financial constraints\\u2019, the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan\\u2019s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open \\u2018an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved\\u2019. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance\\u2019s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs\\u2019. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country\\u2019s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in March 2023, CPHGC warned that it was at risk of defaulting on its loan repayment obligations due to overdue power purchase payments from the Central Power Purchasing Agency-Guaranteed (CPPA-G).\",\"On October 24, 2017, China Power Hub Generation Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (CPHGC) signed a $1,496,000,000 syndicated loan agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks \\u2014 including China Development Bank (CDB, lead arranger), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank, co-lead arranger), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), and Bank of Communications Co. Limited (BOCOM) \\u2014 for the 2\\u00d7660MW Imported Coal Based Independent Power Generation Project at Hub. According to CPHGC's upfront tariff application to Pakistan\\u2019s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, the estimated borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are as follows: a maturity period of 14 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 450 basis points (4.5%). The borrower purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. As sources of collateral, the borrower also pledged shareholdings, assets, accounts, electricity payment receivables, and its Sinosure insurance policy.

This GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 21 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and and 1% interest rate. Then, on January 13, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Mozambique signed a preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement worth $312,400,000 for the Beira-Machipanda (N6) Road Rehabilitation Project. This PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. Project ID#31066 captures the GCL and Project ID#57336 captures the PBC. The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group Co., Ltd. (AFECC) and Mozambique's National Roads Administration, which was signed on March 27, 2012.   The $416.5 million project involved the upgrading and rehabilitation of an 288 km road from Beira to Machipanda and a bridge that was constructed over the River Pungue. The completion of the project was expected to shorten the journey from the western border of Mozambique to the port of Beira from 7 hours to 4 hours, thereby facilitating regional connectivity, stimulating the development of agriculture, tourism and other industries along the route, and promoting exports.   AFECC was the contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 10, 2014. However, construction did not begin until April 1, 2015. The project was originally scheduled for completion on March 31, 2018. However, it was ultimately completed and National Highway No. 6 was opened to traffic on November 14, 2019. The collection of tolls commenced on January 1, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Beira-Machipanda (N6) Road Rehabilitation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique\\u2019s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283).\",\"On April 10, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ecuador signed a $312,480,966.99 buyer's credit loan (BCL) agreement (Contract No. 1410302052013210568) for the 275MW Minas-San Francisco Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: an annual interest rate of 6 month LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin, a grace period of 4 years, and a maturity of 15 years. It is backed by a credit insurance policy from Sinosure.   As of December 2018, the loan had achieved an 31.9% disbursement rate ($99,967,764.14 out of $312,480,967). The borrower made principal repayments worth $15,624,048.35 on September 21, 2018, $15,624,048.35 on March 21, 2019, $15,624,048.35 on September 21, 2019, $15,624,048.35 on March 21, 2020, and $19,229,597.97 on March 21, 2022. It did not make any principal repayments on the originally scheduled repayment dates of September 21, 2020, March 21, 2021, September 21, 2021, and September 21, 2022. The loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding was $298,856,918.64 September 21, 2018, $281,232,870.29 as of March 21, 2019, $265,608,821.94 as of September 21, 2019, $249,984,773.59 as of March 21, 2020, $249,984,773.59 as of September 21, 2020, $249,984,773.59 as of March 21, 2021, $249,984,773.59 as of September 21, 2021, $249,984,773.59 as of December 31, 2021, $230,755,175.62 as of March 21, 2022, $230,755,175.62 as of September 21, 2022, and $230,755,175.62 as of November 30, 2022.  The purpose of the project was to construct the 275MW Minas-San Francisco Hydroelectric Power Plant in the southwest province of Azuay and the cantons of El Oro, Pucar\\u00e1, Zaruma and Pasaje. Upon completion, the power plant was expected to have a maximum annual power generation capacity of 1.291 billion kWh and reduce carbon emissions by 690,000 tons each year. Minas San Francisco is made up of a 54-m-high rolled concrete gravity-type dam that generates a regulation and control reservoir, an intake work located on the right bank of the Jubones River that connects with a 13.9 km driving tunnel. The pressure pipe is developed in two sections that comprise a total drop of 474 meter. The underground powerhouse houses three Pelton-type turbines of 90 MW each.  Harbin Electric International Company Limited was the general contractor responsible for implementation. Its work was overseen by Corporaci\\u00f3n El\\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador (CELEC) and Ministerio de Electricidad y Energ\\u00eda Renovable (MEER). Construction began in March 2012. The excavation of a diversion tunnel was completed in August 2013. The diversion of the Jubones River took place in February 2014. Then, in January 2015, the excavation of the entrance window to the head tunnel was complete. The completion of the powerhouse excavation took place in October 2015. Then, in December 2016, the construction and assembly of the transmission line was completed. The power plant\\u2019s three generator rotors were lowered into place between January 2017 and May 2017. The filling of the reservoir occurred in December 2017. Then, in May 2018, the first rotation of the first turbine-generator took place. As of August 2018, the project had achieved a 99.7% completion rate. All three power generation units were connected to the grid on October 24, 2018. The first power generation unit was officially inaugurated on January 15, 2019. The project\\u2019s official handover ceremony took place on April 9, 2021.   To date, the power plant has reportedly generated over 140 million kWh power, created more than 2,000 jobs, and delivered electricity on a daily basis to nearly 1.2 million people and 2,000 manufacturing companies. However, the project suffered multiple setbacks due to administrative and technical discrepancies with contractors and inspectors, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic. The China Eximbank loan (BCL) that supported this project also underperformed. It was rescheduled twice \\u2014 once in September 2020 (as captured via Project ID#93434) and again in September 2022 (as captured via Project ID#96295).\",\"The purpose of the Extension of Southern Expressway Project (ESEP) was to enhance the efficiency of the transport system by linking the country's major economic centers with Colombo City and other parts of the country. It was also designed to facilitate the activities of the Hambantota International Development Hub Project. It involves a 96 km extension of the Southern Expressway from Matara to Hambantota, and it consists of 4 sections.  ESEP Section 1 consists of the construction of a 30 km length road section from Matara to Beliatta.  ESEP Section 2 consists of the construction of a 26 km length road section from Beliatta to Wetiya. The scope of this project includes the construction of 2 interchanges, 26 underpasses, 7 overpasses, 8 bridges, and 70 box culverts. ESEP Section 3 consists of the construction of a 15 km length road section from Wetiya to Andarawewa. The scope of this project includes the construction of 1 viaduct, 18 underpasses, 5 overpasses, 2 bridges, 45 box culverts, and 6 pipe culverts. This project also includes the construction of the Ranna-Wetiya Road (HR 21) and Sooriyawewa-Galwewa Junction-Embilipitiya Road (HR 06, HR 10).  ESEP Section 4 consists of the construction of a 25 km length road section from Mattala to Hambantota via Andarawewa. The scope of this project includes the construction of 2 viaducts, 1 interchange, 6 bridges, 2 bridge underpasses, 2 overpasses, 10 culvert underpasses, 61 box culverts, and 1 aqueduct.    China Eximbank financed each of these sections of ESEP with four different loans.  On December 23, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $683.5 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [PBC No. (2014) 27 Total No. (321)] for Section 1 (Matara to Beliatta) of ESEP.

It commenced on January 16, 2016 and it was completed on January 19, 2019.  Section 2, which was implemented by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), commenced on October 28, 2016. Its target completion date was October 27, 2019, and as of December 31, 2018, it was 61.23% complete. It was completed on February 23, 2020. Section 3, which was implemented by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), commenced on January 25, 2016, and as of December 31, 2018, it was 88.77% complete.

Its target completion date is May 28, 2019, and as of December 31, 2018, it was 86.06% complete.  Sections 1-4 were complete, and the Southern Expressway opened to traffic on February 23, 2020. The completion of the ESEP project has successfully linked Hambantota Port and Mattala Rajapaksa Hambantota Airport.   However, this project has also encountered debt repayment problems.  On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.\",\"On November 11, 2013, the Export-Import Bank of China and Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance signed a $319,455,921 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [China Eximbank PBC No. (2013) Total 45 No. (289) No. 1420303052013212386] for the Kariba South Hydro Project. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. It is backed by a sovereign repayment guarantee from Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance. An initial loan disbursement of $79.8 million took place on October 31, 2014, leaving a balance of $239.7 million to be disbursed in multiple tranches between 2015 and 2017. The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was $214,554,588 as of December 31, 2016 and $273,700,750 as of December 31, 2017. Its amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $305,331,749.40 as of September 2021.   Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to Kariba Hydro Power Company (Private) Limited (KHPC), which is a special purpose vehicle (project company) that is wholly owned by Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC). KHPC entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) and Nampower. It planned to service the China Eximbank PBC with revenue derived from power sales to ZETDC and Nampower. The lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of $32 million in multiple, lender-controlled escrow accounts: $26 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and $6 million in a Maintenance Reserve Account (MRA). ZPC also agreed to make a $35 million equity contribution to support the project\\u2019s implementation.    This project involved an expansion of the existing 750MW Kariba South hydropower station. The purpose of the expansion was to increase the installed capacity of the Kariba South hydropower station through the addition of two additional units of 150MW each, resulting in an aggregate 1,050MW installed capacity. The Kariba dam is situated in the Zambezi river basin between Zambia and Zimbabwe. There are two hydropower stations at the dam: the Kariba North hydropower station, which is owned by Zambia, and the Kariba South hydropower station, which is owned by Zimbabwe. Kariba South was commissioned in 1962, and it generates electricity from water drawn from Lake Kariba, forcing it through a short intake and vertical penstock to a turbine where hydroelectric power is produced in the coupled generator. The water is then discharged downstream back into the Zambezi river. Sinohydro Bureau 16 Co., LTD was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation of the Kariba South Hydro Project. A groundbreaking ceremony for this project took place on September 4, 2014, and a project completion ceremony was held on March 28, 2018. During the construction process, Sinohydro Bureau 16 Co., LTD reportedly hired and trained local employees and brought more than 3,000 job opportunities to Zimbabwe.    However, the power plant encountered operational challenges after it was constructed and the borrowing institution (KHPC) has breached its contractual obligations with China Eximbank. In a 2016 Report on Parastatals and State Enterprises, Zimbabwe\\u2019s Accountant and Auditor General noted that KHPC and ZPC were in breach of contract for not depositing the cash proceeds from the power purchase agreement into a China Eximbank-controlled escrow account. The report concluded that \\u2018[c]ontrary to the terms set out in the escrow agreement, ZPC power purchase agreement proceeds have not been paid into the said account by ZPC. ZPC confirmed a netted inter-company balance implying that the power proceeds payable to KHPC are being set-off against inter-company receivables from KHPC.\\u2019 Then, on November 25, 2022, Munyaradzi Munodawafa, the Chief Executive Office Zambezi River Authority \\u2014 an entity responsible for the Kariba Dam that is jointly owned by Zimbabwe and neighboring Zambia \\u2014 sent a letter to Zimbabwe Power Company, which noted that water levels at the Kariba South hydroelectric power facility were at record low levels and electricity generation activities could no longer continue. The letter also noted that the Kariba South hydroelectric power facility had used more than its 2022 water allocation and that the Kariba Dam\\u2019s usable storage was only 4.6 percent full.\",\"On February 22, 2012, Reliance Communications Ltd., an Indian mobile network provider, entered into a $925.2 million term loan facility agreement (ICBC Facility I) with China Development Bank Corporation, the Export-Import Bank of China, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC).

Reliance Communications Ltd. entered bankruptcy and liquidation procedures on November 15, 2018, and admitted the supervision by the resolution professionals of Deloitte India. Anil Ambani quit as chairman of the board of Reliance Communications in November 2019. Then, on May 22, 2020, the Commercial Division of the High Court of England and Wales in London ordered Anil Ambani, the former chairman of the bankrupted Reliance Communications Ltd., to pay approximately $717 million to CDB, ICBC, and China Eximbank within 21 days, pursuant to the February 22, 2012 facility agreement and a binding personal guarantee. According to an order from the court, the defendant (Anil Ambani) was to pay a sum of $716,917,681.51 to the claimant (tCDB, ICBC, and China Eximbank) pursuant to the guarantee, including the principal amount outstanding under the facility agreement of $549,804,650.16; interest outstanding as of May 22, 2020 of $51,923,451.49; and default interest due of $115,189,579.86. \",\"On March 9, 2011, China Development Bank (CDB) provided a $300 million loan (\\\"Facility II\\\") to Reliance Communications to help modernize its equipment and payoff maturing loans.

The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 4% interest rate. On September 30, 2008, the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an on-lending agreement (No. 17/\\u0110LUT/H\\u0110) with Vietnam National Chemical Group (Vinachem), a Vietnamese state-owned enterprise for this project.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the ultimate borrower to partially finance a $480 million EPC contract with China Huanqiu Contracting and Engineering Corporation, which was signed on November 15, 2007.   As of December 31, 2014, China Eximbank had disbursed $225 million of the PBC and ultimately disbursed $249,999,999. As of March 31, 2017, Vinachem had repaid $62.5 million of the principal.  The loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized with) the fertilizer plant that Vinachem developed with the loan proceeds. The Government of Vietnam also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the China Eximbank PBC.   The Ninh Binh Nitrogenous Fertilizer Plant Construction Project was co-financed by Vinachem, Ninh Binh provincial government, and Vietnam Development Bank.   The purpose of the project was to construct a nitrogenous fertilizer plant (coal-based urea production plant) in Ninh Phuc Industrial Zone within Ninh Binh province. Upon completion, the plant was expected to provide the domestic market with 560,000 tons of urea fertilizer per year.   China Huanqiu Contracting and Engineering Corporation was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A project commencement ceremony was held on May 10, 2008 and the plant went into use on March 30, 2012 (after 45 months of construction). It began commercial operations in September 2012, and the plant was operating at 90% capacity as of November 2013.   The plant temporarily halted its operations in March 2016 due to financial losses. The plant ended its operations in July 2016.  Then, on April 18, 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued an official letter (No. 3285 / BCT-HC), announcing that Vinachem was not generating enough cash flow to meet its repayment obligations related to the China Eximbank loan for the Ninh Binh Nitrogenous Fertilizer Plant Construction Project. The plant resumed operations on January 22, 2018 at 80 percent of its designed capacity. However, its indebtedness and lack of access to working capital put its long-run solvency in jeopardy.   In March 2019, Vinachem Chairman Nguyen Phu Cuong announced that, if the difficulties at the fertilizer plant (the largest, wholly-owned project of Vinachem) were not resolved, the project could \\\"bring down the whole corporation.\\\" By the end of 2019, Ninh Ninh Fertilizer Company had negative equity of VND 3,392 billion (VND 9,837 billion in total assets and VND 13,184 billion in total liabilities), and accumulated losses amounted to VND 5,706 billion. China Eximbank ultimately held the Ministry of Finance of Vietnam responsible for loan repayment rather than Vinachem. \",\"On June 14, 2011, China's Eximbank and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Government of Belarus signed a $654,163,995 syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement [\\u2116 BLA201104] for the JSC Svetlogorsk Cellulose and Cardboard Factory Construction Project. The loan carried an 11.5-year maturity, a 7.5-year grace period, annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The loan was scheduled for repayment between January 2019 and January 2023. AidData estimates that China Eximbank contributed $327,081,997.5 (captured via Project ID#42318) and ICBC also contributed $327,081,997.5 (captured via Project ID#98789) to this syndicated loan.  Then, on April 26, 2012, the Government of Belarus on-lent the proceeds of the loan to a state-owned company called JSC \\\"Svetlogorsk Pulp and Cardboard Mill\\\" (or \\u041e\\u0410\\u041e \\u00ab\\u0421\\u0432\\u0435\\u0442\\u043b\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e\\u0440\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0446\\u0435\\u043b\\u043b\\u044e\\u043b\\u043e\\u0437\\u043d\\u043e-\\u043a\\u0430\\u0440\\u0442\\u043e\\u043d\\u043d\\u044b\\u0439 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043c\\u0431\\u0438\\u043d\\u0430\\u0442\\u00bb or \\u041e\\u0410\\u041e \\\"\\u0421\\u0432\\u0435\\u0442\\u043b\\u043e\\u0433\\u043e\\u0440\\u0441\\u043a\\u0425\\u0438\\u043c\\u0432\\u043e\\u043b\\u043e\\u043a\\u043d\\u043e\\u201d). JSC \\\"Svetlogorsk Pulp and Cardboard Mill\\\" then used the loan proceeds to finance approximately 85% of the cost ($800 million) of a commercial contract that it signed with China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd. (CAMCE) on October 11, 2010.  The purpose of the project was to support the construction of a bleached sulfate production facility at the cellulose and cardboard plant in the city of Svetlogorsk. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the facility would have the capacity to produce 400,000 tons per year of bleached sulphate cellulose (used in paper and cardboard production).  CAMCE was the general (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation and it appears to have hired CMEC as a subcontractor. Construction began on or around May 28, 2012. The project was completed on December 10, 2017. However, it encountered a number of problems during and after implementation. CAMCE allegedly violated building codes and supplied defective equipment. A strong and unpleasant odor was also reported within the vicinity of the newly constructed facility. As of 2019, the facility was not fully operational.  The China Eximbank/ICBC loan that was issued for the JSC Svetlogorsk Cellulose and Cardboard Factory Construction Project also financially underperformed vis-a-vis the lenders' original expectations. JSC \\\"Svetlogorsk Pulp and Cardboard Mill\\\" could not fully service its debts to China Eximbank and ICBC and the Ministry of Finance of Belarus had to step in and provide partial loan repayment. JSC \\\"Svetlogorsk Pulp and Cardboard Mill\\\" is a loss-making enterprise that has not shown a net profit since 2012. At the beginning of 2019, the company's total debt (about $900 million) was significantly higher than the value of its fixed assets.\",\"On September 20, 2007, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and the Chad\\u2019s Ministry of Petroleum and  Energy signed an agreement in which they agreed to jointly construct the N'Djamena (Djarmaya) oil refinery.

Nearly two years later, in May 2011, China Eximbank and SRN SA signed a $330 million buyer's credit loan (BCL) agreement for the N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project (captured via Project ID#72356). The BCL, which was reportedly the first one ever issued by China Eximbank to an overseas joint venture, carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 300 basis points.  CNPC provided a repayment guarantee for 60% of the face value of the China Eximbank PBC and SHT provided a repayment guarantee to cover the remaining 40% of the face value of the PBC. CNPC and SHT also pledged their respective shares in Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 de Raffinage de N'Djam\\u00e9na (SRN) SA as sources of collateral.  Sinosure refused to insure the BCL, which it deemed too risky. Additionally, CNPC Finance (HK) Limited issued a loan worth approximately $70 million to SRN SA in May 2011 (captured via Project ID#91918). The borrowing terms of the loan from CNPC Finance (HK) Limited are unknown. The proceeds of the China Eximbank BCL and the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan were used to fund SHT\\u2019s equity contribution (worth approximately 40% of $1 billion) to Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 de Raffinage de N'Djam\\u00e9na (SRN) SA.   The N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project had two components: the construction of an oil refinery in Djarmaya that is located to the north of N'Djamena and capable of producing 20,000 to 60,000 barrels a day; and the construction of a 311 km pipeline connecting the R\\u00f4nier and Mimosa oilfields in Bongor Basin (in eastern-central) Chad to the refinery in Djarmaya (Note: Block H of the R\\u00f4nier oil field is fully owned by CNPC).   The contractor responsible for project implementation was PetroChina Engineering Construction, which is a subsidiary of PetroChina. Project implementation commenced on October 26, 2008 and reached completion on June 29, 2011. Then, on July 10, 2011, the refinery produced its first batch of diesel fuel. In January 2012, the Government of Chad suspended the oil refinery deal with CNPC and announced that it would expel the Chinese director of the refinery and renegotiate the deal. Disagreements over fuel prices had caused the relationship between the joint venture partners to deteriorate. The refinery restarted operations in February 2012. However, in August 2013, the Government of Chad suspended CNPC\\u2019s operations in Chad, accusing CNPC of violating environmental standards at the company\\u2019s R\\u00f4nier oilfield. Work resumed shortly thereafter but was halted again in May 2014, after CNPC refused to pay a $1.2 billion fine. Preparing to take the dispute to international arbitration, the Government of Chad in October 2014 threatened to revoke and re-auction CNPC\\u2019s oil exploration licenses.  The dispute was settled the same month when CNPC agreed to pay a $400 million fine and concede to the Government of Chad a 10% stake in existing oil operations in the country, as well as a 25% stake in future oil operations. In exchange, the arbitration case was dropped and CNPC was permitted to export oil through the Chad-Cameroon pipeline.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  After a sharp decline in oil prices in 2014-2015, Chad experienced an economic recession and a debt crisis and Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 de Raffinage de N\\u2019djamena (SRN) SA sought to renegotiate the borrowing terms of the China Eximbank loan for the N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project. A rescheduling agreement was finalized in April 2017: China Eximbank agreed to the lengthen the maturity of the loan and reschedule arrears that had accumulated (as captured via Project ID#55744). It appears that China Eximbank did not require the accumulated arrears to be repaid before rescheduling the maturity of the loan.\",\"On September 1, 2010, China Eximbank and the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) signed a $295,927,736 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Genale Dawa III Hydroelectric Power Station Project. The borrowing terms of the BCL were as follows: a 12 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and a 2.43% interest rate. The Government of Ethiopia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a $451,058,001 commercial (EPC) contract [Contract N0.33.20/1/02)] between EEPCo and China Gezhouba Group Company (CGGC) which was signed on September 18, 2009 and modified on September 26, 2010.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 4,053,424,658 loan achieved a 111% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 15 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,499,623,058) between 2014 and 2019: an ETB 234,280,303 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 158,812,261 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 194,174,757 disbursement on April 8, 2014, an ETB 1,200,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 404,040,404 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 265,556,593 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 102,387,246 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 405,453,493 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 153,171,320 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 244,603,535 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 145,293,164 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 27,576,322 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 522,418,088 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 45,062,662 disbursement on April 7, 2017, and an ETB 396,792,911 disbursement on March 27, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct the 254MW Genale-Dawa III multipurpose hydropower plant. The plant consists of a concrete faced rock fill dam and an underground powerhouse. Based on the estimated sedimentation level, the project will have a lifetime of more than 1,000 years. The dam site is located in a low seismic hazard area of class I. The dam is 110m high, 456m wide and 450m long. It is made with groutable and non-erodible rock and has a volume of 3.2 million cubic metres (mm3). At the full capacity, the dam can store up to 2,570mm3 of water. It has a catchment area of 10,445km2 and a fill volume of 890,000m3. The dam spillway is an open chute type with an ogee weir crest and three radial spillway gates. The underground powerhouse is installed with three vertical Francis turbine generators with a capacity of 84.7MW each. It is housed within an underground cavern measuring 60m-long, 20m-wide and 41m deep and also includes auxiliary equipment. A 12.4km long, 8.1m diameter headrace tunnel carries water from the dam through a 188m deep steel-lined vertical shaft to a three-pronged manifold. The manifold feeds the water to the turbine inlet valves of the three turbines housed in the powerhouse. A 820m long tailrace tunnel and a 480m long open channel returns the water back to the river. A transformer cavern is located downstream of the powerhouse and includes three step-up transformers. The electricity generated is transferred from the transformers to a 230kV/400kV switchyard located above ground through a 500m long cable tunnel.   The project area is located in Kobadi, some 400 km (air distance) south-east of Addis Ababa and some 200 km (air distance) north of the border with Kenya. The scheme, including the reservoir and power waterways, extends over a river corridor some 55 km long. The approximate centroid of the project area lies at latitude 5\\u00ba 38' North and longitude 39\\u00ba 43' East.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, several other contractors were involved in the project. Stantec, a US-based company, provided design, planning, management and consulting services. Lahmeyer International, a German company, conducted the feasibility study. Tunnelpro, an Italy-based supplier, provided tunnel boring machines.   Project implementation commenced in March 2011 and the project was originally expected to commence on January 1, 2010 and reach completion within 48.5 months (January 15, 2014). However, the project encountered multiple implementation delays. An inauguration ceremony was held to commemorate the project\\u2019s completion on February 4, 2020. The project temporarily employed 390 Ethiopian workers.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 254MW Genale Dawa III Hydroelectric Power Station Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On May 21, 2014, after submitting a performance guarantee and an application for the establishment of a special purpose vehicle (project company), a consortium consisting of Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co., Ltd. (and its subsidiary in Hong Kong) and Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co., Ltd. (and its subsidiary in Hong Kong) was granted a Letter of Intention (LOI) by the Government of Pakistan, thereby officially obtaining the right to develop the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project.

By July 23, 2014, a senior management team was in place at Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. In November 2014, a project feasibility study report was approved after an assessment was made by experts from the Electric Power Planning & Engineering Institute (EPPEI) and the Government of Punjab. On November 21, 2014, SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation was selected as the EPC contractor through bidding.  Then, in February 2017, four Chinese state-owned commercial banks \\u2014 the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) \\u2014 signed a $1.44 billion syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit (facility) agreement with Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. for the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. The estimated borrowing terms of the buyer\\u2019s credit are as follows: a 14-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an all-in 4.95% interest rate (6-month LIBOR plus a 4.5% margin), and a 5.26% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and granted a 27.2% guaranteed return on equity to the project sponsors (investors).  ICBC's contribution is captured via Project ID#52659. BOC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92302. CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92303. ABC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92304.  The total cost of the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project was $1.808 billion. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) \\u2014 as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Initiative \\u2014 and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Project ID #52659 captures the debt financing component and Project ID#54134 captures the equity financing component.

The project site is located about 12 miles from Sahiwal and 9.3 miles from Okara cantonment, just north of the road which connects the two towns, in Pakistan's Punjab Province. Its exact locational coordinates are 30\\u00b042\\u203255\\u2033N 73\\u00b014\\u203220\\u2033E. The 690 hectare project site was given to the Chinese side by the Pakistani government free of charge. PowerChina Nuclear Engineering Company and SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation (a subsidiary of PowerChina) were the general EPC contractors responsible for implementation.  A groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 30, 2014. Foundation soil replacement and pile foundation tests commenced on February 6, 2015. Construction began on July 31, 2015. Unit 1 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on May 24. 2017. Unit 2 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on June 8. 2017. All network-related tests were completed on October 12, 2017. The project achieved its Commercial Operations Date (COD) and the power plant was connected to the national grid on October 28, 2017. As part of a build, operate, transfer (BOT) agreement, the power plant's ownership is to be transferred from the project company to the Government of Punjab after 30 years of operation.  However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In April 2018, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 20 billion (approximately $172 million), which reportedly brought the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project to \\u2018to the brink of closure\\u2019. It also made it more difficult for Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. to source the coal needed to power the plant (since Pakistan Railway demands advance payment for coal transportation). Then, in a letter dated August 7, 2022, Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. acknowledged that more than 0.5 million tons of South African coal were being stored in Port Qasim and awaiting clearance because it was unable to pay the coal supplier.   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without \\u2018early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017\\u2019. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called \\u2018discos\\u2019). However, \\u2018due to various technical and financial constraints\\u2019, the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan\\u2019s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open \\u2018an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved\\u2019.

Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called \\u2018discos\\u2019). However, \\u2018due to various technical and financial constraints\\u2019, the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan\\u2019s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open \\u2018an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved\\u2019. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance\\u2019s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this \\u201c[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs\\u2019. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country\\u2019s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).\",\"On May 21, 2014, after submitting a performance guarantee and an application for the establishment of a special purpose vehicle (project company), a consortium consisting of Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co., Ltd. (and its subsidiary in Hong Kong) and Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co., Ltd. (and its subsidiary in Hong Kong) was granted a Letter of Intention (LOI) by the Government of Pakistan, thereby officially obtaining the right to develop the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. One day later, on May 22, 2014, Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle (project company) and joint venture of Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co. Ltd. (51% ownership stake) and Shandong Ruyi Science & Technology Group (49% ownership stake) \\u2014 was officially incorporated and established to assume responsibility for the development, investment, and management the two 660 MW coal-fired units in Sahiwal.  By July 23, 2014, a senior management team was in place at Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. In November 2014, a project feasibility study report was approved after an assessment was made by experts from the Electric Power Planning & Engineering Institute (EPPEI) and the Government of Punjab. On November 21, 2014, SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation was selected as the EPC contractor through bidding.  Then, in February 2017, four Chinese state-owned commercial banks \\u2014 the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) \\u2014 signed a $1.44 billion syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit (facility) agreement with Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. for the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. The estimated borrowing terms of the buyer\\u2019s credit are as follows: a 14-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an all-in 4.95% interest rate (6-month LIBOR plus a 4.5% margin), and a 5.26% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and granted a 27.2% guaranteed return on equity to the project sponsors (investors).  ICBC's contribution is captured via Project ID#52659. BOC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92302. CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92303. ABC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92304.  The total cost of the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project was $1.808 billion. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) \\u2014 as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Initiative \\u2014 and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Project ID #52659 captures the debt financing component and Project ID#54134 captures the equity financing component.  The purpose of the project was to construct 1320 MW coal-fired power plant \\u2014 with two 660 MW supercritical coal-fired units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) \\u2014 with synchronous installation of high-efficiency electrostatic precipitator and flue gas desulfurization facilities. The project site is located about 12 miles from Sahiwal and 9.3 miles from Okara cantonment, just north of the road which connects the two towns, in Pakistan's Punjab Province. Its exact locational coordinates are 30\\u00b042\\u203255\\u2033N 73\\u00b014\\u203220\\u2033E. The 690 hectare project site was given to the Chinese side by the Pakistani government free of charge. PowerChina Nuclear Engineering Company and SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation (a subsidiary of PowerChina) were the general EPC contractors responsible for implementation.  A groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 30, 2014. Foundation soil replacement and pile foundation tests commenced on February 6, 2015. Construction began on July 31, 2015. Unit 1 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on May 24. 2017. Unit 2 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on June 8. 2017. All network-related tests were completed on October 12, 2017. The project achieved its Commercial Operations Date (COD) and the power plant was connected to the national grid on October 28, 2017. As part of a build, operate, transfer (BOT) agreement, the power plant's ownership is to be transferred from the project company to the Government of Punjab after 30 years of operation.  However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In April 2018, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 20 billion (approximately $172 million), which reportedly brought the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project to \\u2018to the brink of closure\\u2019. It also made it more difficult for Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. to source the coal needed to power the plant (since Pakistan Railway demands advance payment for coal transportation). Then, in a letter dated August 7, 2022, Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. acknowledged that more than 0.5 million tons of South African coal were being stored in Port Qasim and awaiting clearance because it was unable to pay the coal supplier.   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without \\u2018early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017\\u2019.

It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country\\u2019s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). \",\"On September 16, 2014, China Eximbank and the Sri Lanka Ministry of Finance signed a $494.03 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK No. PBC (2014) 15 Total No.(309)] for Phase III of the Outer Circular Highway Project (Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya Section). The face value of the PBC was subsequently downsized to $378,545,530. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC (loan) to finance approximately 95% of the cost of a commercial contract [ID# RDA/OCH/NS/II] between Sri Lanka's Road Development Authority (RDA) and Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC) , which was signed on February 22, 2013.   China Eximbank disbursed $12,764,499.92 in 2015, $47,825,409.95 in 2016, $78,892,477.69 in 2017, $80,969,279 in 2018, $82,451,347 in 2019, and $86,161,576 in 2020. The loan had achieved a 102.7% disbursement rate ($389,064,589.56 out of $378,545,530) as of December 31, 2021. The borrower made repayments worth $25,236,368 in 2020 and $25,236,368 in 2021.   The loan's amount outstanding was $128,963,328 as of December 31, 2017, $209,932,607 as of December 31, 2018, $292,383,954 as of December 31, 2019, $353,309,162 as of December 31, 2020, $328,072,794 as of December 31, 2021, and $315,454,610 as of June 30, 2022.  By early 2022, it was clear that the loan was non-performing. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.   The project was to construct an expressway in the outskirts of Colombo which connects with the Southern Expressway and other national roads radiating from Colombo city in order to mitigate traffic congestion in the Colombo Metropolitan Region and enhance connectivity with other regions of the country, thereby contributing to the strengthening of economic development among the regions in Sri Lanka. The Outer Circular Highway (OCH) is located at the Colombo Metropolitan Region and passes through two administrative districts, namely Colombo and Gampaha. The OCH Project consists of three main sections: Phase I runs from Kottawa to Kaduwela (11.0 km) (Phase I); Phase II runs from Kaduwela to Kadawatha (8.9 km); and Phase III runs from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya (9.32 km).   Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction commenced on January 1, 2016. The originally anticipated completion date was June 30, 2019. However, this project faced delays due to poor contractor performance, several houses refusing to vacate, and land acquisition problems at Kadawatha IC due to trade union activities in the survey department.. This project was ultimately completed on November 7, 2019.\",\"On September 16, 2014, during Xi Jinping's state visit to the Maldives, the Chinese Government and the Government of the Maldives signed a \\u2018Preliminary Contract Agreement on the Expansion and Upgrading of Ibrahim Nasir International Airport\\u2019. Then, on December 28, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of the Maldives signed a $373,838,500 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for the Velana International Airport Upgrade and Expansion Upgrade and Expansion Project. The PBC (loan), which went into effect on August 18, 2016, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 3% interest rate. The loan\\u2019s principal was to be repaid by the borrower in thirty equal semiannual installments on January 21 and July 21 of each year and the first repayment was scheduled to commence on the first available payment date falling five years after the date of withdrawal (November 2, 2016).  The lender expected the borrower to use the revenues from an Airport Development Fee (ADF) to repay the loan.  The Maldives Ministry of Finance and Treasury used the proceeds of the China Eximbank loan to on-lend to Maldives Airports Company Limited (MACL) \\u2014 a state-owned enterprise in the Maldives \\u2014 in local currency (Maldivian Rufiyaa). As of December 31, 2018, China Eximbank had disbursed $211,137,789. It made additional disbursements worth $6,255,639 during calendar year 2020 and $38,474,600 during calendar year 2021. China Eximbank had disbursed $335,363,900 as of December 31, 2020 and $373,838,500 as of December 31, 2021. The borrower did not make any repayments to China Eximbank during calendar year 2020 or calendar year 2021. The loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding was $321,953,650 as of December 31, 2019, $335,363,900 as of December 31, 2020, and $373,838,500 as of December 31, 2021.    The total cost of the Velana International Airport Upgrade and Expansion Upgrade and Expansion Project was $800 million and it was reportedly co-financed by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, the Saudi Fund for Development, the OPEC Fund for International Development, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).   The purpose of the project was to support the construction of an additional runway and bridge leading to the Velana International Airport (previously known as Ibrahim Nasir International airport) in Mal\\u00e9, Maldives.  More specifically, the project involved the construction of a new 3,400 meters long and 65 meters wide runway, reclaiming land, and developing a 45 million liter capacity fuel farm and an 80,000 ton cargo complex.   Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It was given the commercial contract to expand the airport after a $511 million deal with India\\u2019s GMR Infrastructure was canceled by the Maldivian government. The project's groundbreaking ceremony was on February 27, 2017. The paving of the new runway was completed on August 24, 2018.  Then, an A380 airplane landed on the newly constructed runway on September 18, 2018. The Global Times declared this moment as the project\\u2019s official completion date.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (loan) for the Velana International Airport Upgrade and Expansion Upgrade and Expansion Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2020, the China Eximbank loan for the Velana International Airport Upgrade and Expansion Upgrade and Expansion Project was restructured through the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Debt service payments under the loan were deferred until December 31, 2020 and the outstanding balance of the loan were transferred to a new China Eximbank loan instrument along with the capitalization of accrued interest. Debt service payments under the loan were again deferred from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021 and the outstanding balance of the loan was again transferred to a second, new China Eximbank loan instrument along with the capitalization of accrued interest.  Debt service payments were deferred yet again under the loan from July 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 and the outstanding balance of the loan was again transferred to a third, new China Eximbank loan instrument along with the capitalization of accrued interest. As of December 31, 2021, the amount outstanding under the first, new China Eximbank loan instrument was $3,288,673. As of December 31, 2021, the amount outstanding under the second, new China Eximbank loan instrument was $3,403,170. As of December 31, 2021, the amount outstanding under the third, new China Eximbank loan instrument was $3,372,270.\",\"In March 2003, the Chinese Government and the Government of Pakistan signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the construction of a second nuclear power plant (Chashma II) with a 300 MW capacity at Chashma, Pakistan, where a nuclear plant (Chashma I) was already installed. Then, on August 3, 2004, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $150 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [ID# BLA 04083] for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project (or Unit 2 of CHASNUPP). The PBC, which is captured via Project ID#35108, carried the following borrowing terms: a 3% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 7 year grace period.  Then, on March 31, 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2005) 03 TOTAL NO. (125)] worth RMB 1,598,764,499.79 (or approximately $200 million) for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project (or Unit 2 of CHASNUPP). The GCL, which is captured via Project ID#35262, carried a 2% interest rate but the other borrowing terms are unknown.   The PBC had achieved a 69.5% disbursement rate ($104,390,000 out of $150,000,000) as of June 30, 2008, an 83.5% disbursement rate ($125,390,000 out of $150,000,000) as of June 30, 2009, and an 88.2% disbursement rate ($132,390,000 out of $150,000,000) as of June 30, 2010. PBC repayments amounts to $9,223,106.80 ($6,594,213.63 in principal and $2,628,893.17 in interest) from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013. The GCL had achieved a 62.2% disbursement rate (RMB 994,496,299.79 out of RMB 1,598,764,499.79) as of June 30, 2008, a 64.4% disbursement rate (RMB 1,095,731,800 out of RMB 1,598,764,499.79) as of June 30, 2009, and a 75.7% disbursement rate (RMB 1.287,251,299.09 out of RMB 1,598,764,499.79) as of June 30, 2010. GCL repayments amounted to $23,475,896.05 ($18,919,655.35 in principal and $4,556,240.70) from July 1, 2012 to June 30, 2013.   The Chashma Nuclear Power Plant (or CHASNUPP) is a large commercial nuclear power plant located in the vicinities of Chashma colony and Kundian in Punjab in Pakistan. Its exact locational coordinates are 32.390278, 71.4625. The purpose of the China Eximbank-financed project was to construct a second unit (CNP-300 reactor) at the power plant (known as C2 or CHASNUPP-II) with nominal difference of generating a gross electrical capacity of 325 MWe with a net output of about 300 MW.   China Zhongyuan Engineering Company (CZEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on April 8, 2005. The Chashma II power plant was officially inaugurated on May 10, 2011.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank government concessional loan for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the government concessional loan agreement for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-028]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the government concessional loan agreement for Unit 2 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project.

China Eximbank agreed to cover 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. This 'mixed credit' arrangement produced four different financial commitments: two preferential buyer's credits (PBC), one government concessional loan (GCL), and one buyer's credit loan (BCL). On January 14, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $382,848,800 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 50 TOTAL NO. (294)]. Its borrowing terms are unknown (captured via Project ID#92413).

(509)] carrying a 1% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and an 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41916). On December 15, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $3,618,151,200 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) and Government of Pakistan loan ID# PBC-2015-18-360] for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41918). This agreement was amended on October 8, 2019 [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) (A)], but the purpose of the amendment is unknown. Additionally, on December 18, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $2.25 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401 and BCL 2015212932] carrying a 6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41917).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent some or all of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) -- a federally funded independent governmental agency -- at a 15% interest rate. The Government of Pakistan also reportedly issued sovereign guarantees for all four China Eximbank loans that supported the project. In December 2015, the amounts outstanding under all four China Eximbank loans (worth $5.668 billion) were reportedly transferred by the Government of Pakistan to PAEC (as the direct borrower).   The purpose of the project was to construct units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), which is located in Paradise Point in Karachi within Sindh Province.  China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It is using Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 26, 2013. Then, a major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called \\u2018cold functional tests\\u2019 began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. K-2 was ultimately connected to the national grid on March 18, 2021. It was officially inaugurated on May 21, 2021 and put into operation on May 24, 2021. The K-3 reactor came online on March 4, 2022. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020.  There are some indications that the $382.8 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2019, PAEC sought the Prime Minister's approval to have the interest rates of the China Eximbank loans for Units 2 and 3 of the KANUPP Project reset to their original levels (when they were first issued by China Eximbank). Local sources reported at the time that the electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was set on the basis of actual electricity generation costs and on-lending at a 15% rate increased actual electricity generation costs by PKR 108 billion (necessitating an PKR 1.8/kWh increase in the tariff rate). However, it is unclear if the Prime Minister approved PAEC\\u2019s request. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the preferential buyer\\u2019s credit agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-036]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the preferential buyer\\u2019s credit for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer\\u2019s credit for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project.

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 2 years, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.3% margin. The loan is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of the Government of Maldives. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $434 million commercial contract with China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC). HDC contracted a $65.1 million loan from the Singapore Branch of Credit Suisse AG on December 13, 2017 to finance the other 15% of the commercial contract cost.   The first ICBC loan disbursement took place on April 20, 2018. Total loan disbursements amounted to $209,076,876.84 by September 2018 and $221,098,337 by December 31, 2018. ICBC made additional loan disbursements to HDC worth $87,286,256 during calendar year 2020. The borrower made loan repayments to ICBC worth $14,188,462 during calendar year 2020 and $14,820,153 during calendar year 2021.  The ICBC loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was $209,076,877 as of September 2018, $221,098,337 as of December 31, 2018, $281,613,744 as of December 31, 2019, $354,711,539 as of December 31, 2020, and $339,891,386 as of December 31, 2021.   The purpose of the project was to construct 7,000 apartments in Hulhumal\\u00e9. The project involved the construction of 16 high-rise (25 story) buildings and 451,900 square meters of floor space. Each housing unit was to measure 550 square feet, featuring two bedrooms and two bathrooms. Upon completion, the \\u2018social housing\\u2019 project was expected to provide public housing for nearly 30,000 people and created approximately 1,600 jobs for local communities.  All construction materials such as steel and cement were to be transported from China.   China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of October 2017, it was expected that the 7,000 housing units would be complete by the end of 2018.  CSCEC began work on the project on November 18, 2017, after a groundbreaking ceremony attended by Maldives President Abdulla Yameen. The project was officially completed on April 7, 2020,  despite complications resulting form the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there were still construction activities underway in May 2020, with CSEC and HDC constructing labor quarters in Hulhumal\\u00e9 Phase II.   There are some indications that the ICBC loan has underperformed financially and that the borrower (HDC) has had difficulty meeting its repayment obligations to the lender.  On October 18, 2018 HDC entered into a short-term loan agreement with the Maldives Ministry of Finance and Treasury amounting to MVR 94 million for the purpose of refinancing the interest payment obligation falling due in the month of April 2019 under the ICBC loan agreement for Phase 2 of the 7000 Housing Units Project. The disbursement of the loan was made on October 18, 2018. The loan was obtained for a duration of 6 months, and it was repayable over two equal installments with first repayment starting after a grace period of two months from the date of disbursement; interest was charged and payable on a monthly basis at a rate of 9% per annum.  Then, on April 22, 2019. HDC entered into a short-term loan agreement with the Maldives Ministry of Finance and Treasury amounting to MVR 106,496,611 for the purpose of refinancing the interest payment obligation falling due in the month of October 2019 under the ICBC loan agreement for Phase 2 of the 7000 Housing Units Project. The disbursement of the loan was made on April 22, 2019. The loan was obtained for a duration of 24 months, and it was repayable in monthly installments from the date of disbursement; interest was charged and payable on a monthly basis at a rate of 10% per annum. Then, on July 18, 2019, HDC entered into a short-term loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance and Treasury amounting to MVR 37,464,962.45 for the purpose of refinancing the interest payment obligation falling due in the month of July 2019 under the Credit Suisse AG loan agreement for Phase 2 of the 7000 Housing Units Project. The disbursement of the loan was made on July 18, 2019. The loan was obtained for a duration of 12 months, and it was repayable in monthly installments from the date of disbursement; interest was charged and payable on a monthly basis at a rate of 10% per annum.\",\"On April 28, 2016, China Eximbank signed three different loan agreements with the Government of Pakistan for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi\\u2013Lahore Motorway Project.

The Karachi\\u2013Lahore Motorway (KLM) is a 1,694 km (1,053 mile), six-lane, high-speed, limited-access motorway that connects Karachi and Peshawar through Islamabad, Lahore, Multan and Sukkur. It is considered to be a major component of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The 387 km, six-lane Sukkur-Multan section of the motorway follows the left bank of River Indus and it involved the construction of 100 bridges, 468 underpasses, 991 culverts, 11 interchanges, six pairs of service areas, five pairs of rest areas, and 24 toll stations.  A revised feasibility study was completed for this project on June 18, 2014. China State Construction and Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on August 5, 2016, and the project was completed on November 5, 2019.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer\\u2019s credit loan for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi-Lahore Highway Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi-Lahore Highway Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-036].

(2014) 6 TOTAL NO. (300)] with Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development (MINEPAT) for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a commitment fee of 0.25%, a management fee of 0.25%, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 20 years. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a special account to facilitate repayment. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($453,892,716.00) of a commercial contract between the Steering and Monitoring Committee of the Kribi Industrial and Port Complex of Cameroon and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd., which was signed on November 28, 2012. The remaining 15% was to be covered by the Government of Cameroon's MINEPAT.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 80.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 40.1 billion). The loan\\u2019s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 163.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of this 38.5 km (+4.5km) highway construction project is to facilitate access to the Kribi deep-sea port. It involves construction of a 38.5 km 2x2-lane highway, starting from Mboro village and running to Bibolo in the Kribi II district. It also includes the construction of 4.5 km of road that connects Kribi-Lolabe highway to the Ed\\u00e9a-Kribi highway (or Nationale 7 Ed\\u00e9a-Kribi).   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction commenced on January 1, 2015. However, it was temporarily halted on November 26, 2018 due to (a) the failure to appoint a highway operator, (b) the failure to sign an escrow account agreement, and (c) and accumulated payment arrears worth CFA 75.5 billion. As of March 2019, the project had achieved an 88% completion rate. Then, during last few months of 2019, construction was again temporarily halted before resuming in January 2020. CHEC and the Cameroon Ministry of Public Works stated that the project had achieved an 88.14% completion as of January 2020. Then, on December 30, 2020, Cameroon\\u2019s Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance signed a public-private partnership (PPP) contract with CHEC to finance the Cameroonian Government\\u2019s 15% of the project cost, tacitly acknowledging that the Cameroonian Government could not honor its commitment to finance 15% of the commercial contract cost due to a series of crises. The timeline for completion of the project was subsequently revised to August 2021. As of November 3, 2021, the project had achieved a 98.19% completion rate. The project achieved provisional acceptance (completion) on December 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon \\u2014 with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 \\u2014 by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) \\u2014 or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon\\u2019s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini \\u00e0 Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.\\u2019\",\"On May 18, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda signed a $350 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2011) 8 TOTAL NO. 159] for the 51 km Entebbe-Kampala Toll Road Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC (loan) were as follows: a maturity of 20 years, an interest rate of 2%, a grace period of 7 years, a 0.25% management fee, and a 0.75% commitment fee. Toll road revenue was to be deposited in an escrow account and used to service and secure the China Eximbank loan. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of the escrow account was UGX 125,405,431,628 ($37,621,629.48).  According to the Government of Uganda\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the loan ultimately achieved a 100% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 23 loan disbursements (worth $349,999,999.99) between 2012 and 2019: a $52,500,000 disbursement on June 29, 2012, a $52,500,000 disbursement on November 16, 2012, a $5,066,898.31 disbursement on February 21, 2013, a $12,146,943.51 disbursement on June 25, 2013, a $6,343,496.07 disbursement on December 11, 2013, a $11,764,381.60 disbursement on March 13, 2014, a $16,179,136.37 disbursement on June 30, 2014, a $16,338,200.32 disbursement on August 14, 2014, a $19,317,251.42 disbursement on December 8, 2014, a $8,277,420.88 disbursement on March 13, 2015, a $9,100,892.73 disbursement on May 12, 2015, a $8,988,925.79 disbursement on June 24, 2015, a $9,348,021.01 disbursement on October 20, 2015, a $41,280,630.56 disbursement on August 31, 2016, a $9,596,570.36 disbursement on November 17, 2016, a $11,560,298.76 disbursement on December 16, 2016, a $13,092,343.94 disbursement on June 8, 2017, a $5,734,503.47 disbursement on September 25, 2017, a $9,223,099.74 disbursement on March 2, 2018, a $11,206,723.63 disbursement on August 24, 2018, a $3,491,241.99 disbursement on December 21, 2018, a $11,925,107.64 disbursement on March 28, 2019, and a $5,017,911.89 disbursement on May 17, 2019. According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $349,999,999.99 and the loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $282,692,309.99. The 51 km expressway project was expected to cost $476 million, with $126 million of the funding coming from the Government of Uganda.   China Communications Construction Company, Ltd. (CCCC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of the project. The project was supervised by Beijing Expressway Supervision Company. The purpose of the project was to construct a toll road from Entebbe Airport to the country\\u2019s capital, Kampala. It was part of Government of Uganda\\u2019s overall strategy for decongesting Kampala through construction of an inner beltway comprising the Kampala Northern and Southern Bypasses as well as an outer beltway along the edges of the Great Kampala Metropolitan Area. It also aimed to enhance trade and movement between the two cities. The four-lane highway also features at least four toll stations and four interchanges with overpasses, along with a connection to the new highway to Munyonyo, Uganda\\u2019s major international conference destination. The link between the new highway and Munyonyo includes a 3 km, two-lane bridge constructed to run over a Nile River marshland that cuts across the proposed road link.   Construction was originally expected to begin around July 2012, with the project taking three years to complete (July 2015). On November 21, 2012, President Yoweri Museveni Wednesday officially launched the project at a groundbreaking ceremony in Kyengera. The project was ultimately completed on June 15, 2018. However, it has reportedly underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives. Seventeen months after the completion of the project, the tolling system for the expressway was still not operational. Traffic levels were low, which cast doubt on whether the Government of Uganda would generate enough toll revenue to meet its principal and interest repayment obligations under the China Eximbank PBC loan.   Also, as of April 2019, the Government of Uganda had still not passed a law to allow for tolling on the road. But its first loan repayment to China Eximbank was due on May 22, 2019. As of 2021, a company had just been contracted to manage the toll collection process, the expressway remained underutilized, and tolls were still not being collected. While some trips from Kampala to Entebbe have seen significant reductions in travel time, the 51 km expressway has reportedly failed to alleviate the main traffic bottlenecks that affect most trips from the city center. The new expressway does not reach downtown \\u2013 it only connects to the Northern Bypass which is also difficult to reach from downtown during the peak traffic period. It does, however, provide a good connection between the international airport, the President\\u2019s Palace in Entebbe, and the Munyonyo Resort on the lake where President Museveni entertains foreign dignitaries. According to ITDP Africa, which did an analysis of the traffic problem on the old Entebbe-Kampala highway, the traffic bottleneck was almost entirely caused by a few saturated roundabouts and double-parked vehicles at a critical market. ITDP Africa concluded that \\u2018it was clearly not necessary to spend $475 million\\u2019 on the construction of a new expressway.\",\"On November 16, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Kenya signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Olkaria Geothermal Field Project. On May 23, 2012, China Eximbank signed a preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement with the Government of Kenya worth $382,499,999.98 for the drilling services and materials for 80 geothermal wells for the Olkaria Geothermal Field Project. The face value of the PBC was subsequently revised to $367,788,461.54. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: July 21, 2032), and a 7 year grace period.   Then, on August 21, 2012, the Government of Kenya signed a subsidiary loan agreement with Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) -- the largest power producing company in Kenya (responsible for about 69% of the electricity consumed in the country). Through this subsidiary loan agreement, the Government of Kenya on-lent the proceeds of the China Eximbank loan to KenGen. The subsidiary loan had a 2.5% interest rate, 7 year grace period, and a 20 year maturity. The ultimate borrower (KenGen) was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $450 million commercial contract with Great Wall Drilling Company (\\u4e2d\\u56fd\\u77f3\\u6cb9\\u957f\\u57ce\\u94bb\\u63a2\\u5de5\\u7a0b\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8).   The borrower made principal repayments worth $14,711,538.46 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $29,423,076.92 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was $367,788,461.54 as of June 30, 2020, $338,365,384.62 as of June 30, 2021, and $308,942,307.69 as of June 30, 2022.   The purpose of the project was to provide drilling services and materials for 80 geothermal wells at the Olkaria geothermal field. The project was jointly implemented by Great Wall Drilling Company, Kenya's state-owned Geothermal Development Company (GDC), and KenGen. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 23, 2012. Drilling began in September 2012 and the last well was completed in June 2016. However, this project has become a source of local scrutiny and controversy.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Drilling Services And Material for 80 Geothermal Wells at Olkaria Geothermal Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a report from Kenya\\u2019s Auditor General for the Year Ended June 30, 2021, \\u201c[t]he wells were drilled between the year 2011 and 2015 and have never been connected to any plant for generation of power. [Kenya Electricity Generating Company PLC, which is also known as KenGen] has in the meantime continued to pay the principal sum and interest [of the loan] while no corresponding revenue has been realized to date. Further, [KenGen] Management has not given the details of when the wells will likely be utilized in the generation of power. As a result, there is no value for money obtained on the investment [...].'\",\"On September 11, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Kyrgyz Republic\\u2019s Ministry of Finance signed a $386,000,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 38 TOTAL NO. (282)] for the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant Modernization Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.18% management fee. The proceeds from this loan were to be used to finance a $386,000,000 commercial contract (number D-166-21/322) between the Joint Stock Company (JSC) \\u201cElectric Power Plants of Kyrgyzstan\\u201d and Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd. (TBEA).   According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $115,800,000) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that, as of 2014, the loan disbursement rate was 30% ($115,800,000 out of $386,000,000). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 100% as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $389,924,333.33 as of December 31, 2021.   The project sought to install two turbines (units 12 and 13) with a capacity of 150 megawatts at the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant (TPP). As a result, the capacity of Bishkek TPP was expected to increase by 125 megawatts. Prior to project completion, the annual output of electricity at the TPP was one billion kWh. After its modernization through the China Eximbank-financed project, the production of the TPP was expected to reach 1.8 billion kWh. Heat production was also expected to increase from two million gigacalories to three million gigacalories per year.   TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 26, 2014 and the project was completed on August 30, 2017.   However, the Bishkek Therman Power Plant Modernization Project was plagued by controversy. Major failures occurred within 5 months of the power plant being put into operation.  Some boilers collapsed, causing power outages and stopping heating. In 2015, the Chamber of Audits, a state body tasked with overseeing government spending, issued a report questioning why the TBEA contract was not put out to tender when other companies were interested in bidding. Auditors also found that no technical feasibility study was undertaken to evaluate the needs and costs of the project. Nurlan Omurkul, who was chief of the Bishkek TPP, said that he had harbored strong doubts about hiring a company with no track record of building power stations, but that he had been badgered by senior Kyrgyz officials to endorse a decision that he said had obviously already been made. He told the New York Times that \\u2018I\\u2019ve worked my whole life in power and heating plants and knew all along that the Chinese price of $386 million was too expensive.\\u2019 Another Chinese company, China Machinery Engineering Corporation, offered a lower bid, $356 million, according to a parliamentary commission. But the Chinese Embassy reportedly insisted that its offer be dismissed. Eventually, the country\\u2019s former Prime Minister (Jantoro Satybaldiev), former mayor of Bishkek (Kubanychbek Kulmatov), and former Energy Minister (Osmonbek Artykbaev) were arrested on corruption charges and accused of using their positions to lobby for the interests of a Chinese company (TBEA) in the selection process of the contractor for the project. Prosecutors in the case claimed that rigged bidding and inflated pricing would cost the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic as much as $111,252,797.  There are also some indications that the preferential buyer's credit for the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant Modernization Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029]. Under the terms of the agreement (captured via Project ID#96102), the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant Modernization Project.\",\"On January 29, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a $360 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO (2011) TOTAL NO 153] for the 150MW Zongo II Hydroelectric Dam Construction and a 220 kV Transmission Line Project.

According to Government of the DRC's Aid Management Platform (AMP), the loan had disbursed $91,046,040.07 as of July 2019. The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $360,000,000 in 2021 and 2022.   The project involved the construction of the Zongo II hydroelectric dam and the construction of a 220 kV transmission line from the dam to Kinsuka. The dam was expected to produce 150 megawatts per annum and create 2,000 jobs during its three-year construction phase.   Sinohydro and Societe Nationale d'Electricite (SNEL) were jointly responsible for project implementation. Construction began on May 16, 2012 and the project was officially completed on June 22, 2018. There were additional materials supplied during 2020, including 220kV transmission line towers, insulators, ground conductors, optical cables and fittings.  There are indications that this China Eximbank loan has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. The loan was originally expected to enter its principal repayment period in 2019. However, records from the Public Debt Directorate of the DRC's Ministry of Finance demonstrate that no principal payments were made in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2022. This pattern implies that the borrower has accumulated principal arrears. \",\"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as \\u2018Samruk-Kazyna\\u2019). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as \\u2018Kazakhmys Corporation LLC\\u2019 and \\u2018Kazakhmys\\u2019) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC \\u2014 and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower \\u2018principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.\\u2019 As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

Project ID#95750 captures the $300 million borrowing by Samruk-Kazyna for an unspecified purpose. The Bozshakol mine is a large copper mine located in the North Kazakhstan Region. The scope of the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project included the construction of 22 km of highway and 18 km of access roads connected to the mining production site, the construction of 26 km of railroad, the installation of 130 km of pipelines and 500 km of cabling, the installation of fully automated Production Control Systems, the construction of a 5.5 km long Tailing Dam and related structures, the construction of various permanent buildings (measuring 39.000 m\\u00b2), and the construction of concrete, steel-prefabricated buildings.  The project sought to establish facilities able to mine 30 million tons per year. A $560 million EPC contract for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was signed between KAZ Minerals PLC and Alarko Contracting Group on September 20, 2011. China Nonferrous Metal Industry\\u2019s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was also involved in the project\\u2019s complementation. Mobilization work started in March 2012 and construction of the temporary site building and facilities were completed in the same year. Approximately 42.000 m\\u00b3 of concrete production and 5.000 tons of steel construction were completed by May 2013. The panel coating works of the process buildings started in May 2013. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on March 15, 2015.  The completion of construction activities and the commencement of commissioning works was ultimately held on September 29, 2016. The Bozymchak mine is an open-pit copper and gold mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region, Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan (exact locational coordinates: 41.2586, 71.0647). It is estimated to contain combined indicated and inferred resources of 16.5 million tons with 0.95% copper and 1.58 g/t gold. The scope of the project involved the development of the mine and its ancillary facilities. NFC was responsible for implementation. The project\\u2019s pre-feasibility study was completed in July 2008. It was originally expected to reach completion by December 2014. However, the mine was not initially commissioned until March 2014. The mine was fully commissioned and reached its commercial operations date (COD) on or around August 5, 2015. The Bozymchak mine restarted operations on December 26, 2020 after a temporary suspension that began on October 7, 2020, following political instability in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Abyz copper mine and the Nurkazgan copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 50.16861, 73.00333). Stripping works at Abyz mine commenced in January 2014. At that time, it was expected that the mine would recommence production in Q3 of 2014. The Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Akbastau-Kosmurun copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 48.60611,77.78861 and 48.6437, 77.7102). The project commenced on January 30, 2009. Its completion date is unknown. The Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Zhomart copper mine, which exploits the 14 km long Zhaman-Aybat orefield deposits that are located approximately 160 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The first stage of the mine\\u2019s development was commissioned in 2006 with a planned capacity of around 4 million tons of ore a year. The second phase of the project was schedule for implementation from 2012 to 2017 with a production start in 2018. The de facto completion date of the $300 million loan that Samruk-Kazyna contracted for an unspecified purpose was January 2013 (when it was fully repaid).\",\"On September 11, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic's Ministry of Finance signed a $399,989,041 preferential buyer credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No (2013) 37 TOTAL No (281)] for the construction of the Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section (km291-km433) and Balykchy-Aral Section (km183+500-195+486) of the Alternative North-South Road Project. This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Alternative North-South Road Project (or \\u201c\\u0421\\u0442\\u0440\\u043e\\u0438\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u0441\\u0442\\u0432\\u043e \\u0430\\u043b\\u044c\\u0442\\u0435\\u0440\\u043d\\u0430\\u0442\\u0438\\u0432\\u043d\\u043e\\u0439 \\u0430\\u0432\\u0442\\u043e\\u043c\\u043e\\u0431\\u0438\\u043b\\u044c\\u043d\\u043e\\u0439 \\u0434\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u0433\\u0438 \\u0421\\u0435\\u0432\\u0435\\u0440-\\u042e\\u0433, \\u0444\\u0430\\u0437\\u0430 1\\u201d). The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.18% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the loan were used to support a July 8, 2013 commercial contract worth $399,989,041 between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).   According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $99,997,300) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that the loan\\u2019s overall disbursement rate, as of 2014, was 25% ($99,997,300 out of $399,989,041). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 75% ($299,991,780.75 of $399,989,041) as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $303,058,363.40 as of December 31, 2021.  The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazarman-Jalal Abad (km291-km433) section and Balykchy-Aral (km183+500-km195+486) section of the Alternative North-South Road. More specifically, it supported the construction of two road segments: one that runs from Kazarman village to Jalal Abad town (km291-km433) and another than runs from Balykchy (Kyzyl-Zhyldyz) village to Aral village (km183+500-195+486).  The ultimate aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on May 2, 2014. The project was originally scheduled for completion in December 2018. However, as of December 2020, it had still only achieved a 70% completion rate. The project was ultimately completed on November 10, 2021. It passed China Eximbank's final inspection in November 2022.  The are some indications that the preferential buyer's credit for the Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section and Balykchy-Aral Section of Alternative North-South Road Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029]. Under the terms of the agreement (captured via Project ID#96102), the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for the Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section and Balykchy-Aral Section of Alternative North-South Road Project.  The Alternative North-South Road Project has also been plagued by controversy and corruption allegations. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude \\u2014 from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.\",\"On May 24, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Gabon signed an RMB-denominated government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth $70 million for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project. The agreement was signed by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul Toungui and China's ambassador Hxue Jinwei. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 3% interest rate.  Also, on May 24, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Gabon also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement worth $300 million for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance approximately $370 million of a $398 million Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro. The Government of Gabon covered the remaining $28 million cost of the EPC contract.  The Government of Gabon also issued sovereign guarantees for the two loans from China Eximbank.  Project ID#85 captures the GCL, while Project ID#73173 captures the PBC.   The project involved the construction of a dam on the Ogoou\\u00e9 river with 4 Francis turbines capable of generating 160 MW. The dam was built in part to generate power for an iron ore mine in Belinga (see Project ID#630).  The project also involved the construction of two power transmission lines: a 15 km line from the dam site to Franceville, the country's third largest city, and another line from the dam site to Moanda (the largest manganese mining region in Gabon and in the world).  The dam is located 15 km outside of Franceville in the province of Haut-Ogoou\\u00e9, more than 700 km southwest of Libreville, an area where the Compagnie mini\\u00e8re de l\\u2019Ogoou\\u00e9\\u2019s (COMILOG) main manganese mine is located.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction officially began on November 15, 2008, and it was originally anticipated that the construction process will be completed in 54 months (May 15, 2013).   The dam was impounded on April 30, 2013.  Then, the four power generating units went into operation on August 5, 2013. The dam, water diversion system and other civil works passed final inspection by the project owner on July 22, 2014. The power generator set and auxiliary equipment also passed final inspection by the project owner on August 9, 2014, effectively marking the completion of the project.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon\\u2019s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country\\u2019s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon\\u2019s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, \\u2018the stock of [the Government of] Gabon\\u2019s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-\\u00e0-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-\\u00e0-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-\\u00e0-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-\\u00e0-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-\\u00e0-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).\\u2019 Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon\\u2019s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022. \",\"On February 24, 2012, the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic submitted a loan application to China Eximbank for the Datka-Kemin 500kv Transmission Line Construction Project. Then, on June 5, 2012, China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a $389,795,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2012) 20 TOTAL NO. (208)] for the Datka-Kemin 500kv Transmission Line Construction Project. The PBC (loan) agreement was the ratified by the Kyrgyz Parliament June 19, 2012. The loan (PBC) carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The State Agency for Budget Credit Management under the Ministry of Finance of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic on-lent the proceeds of the loan (PBC) to a state-owned company known as National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan, OJSC (or Joint Stock Company \\u201cNational Grid of Kyrgyzstan\\u201d or OJSC Natsionalnaya Elektricheskaya set Kyrgyzstana or OJSC NES of Kyrgyzstan or NEGK).  The proceeds of the loan (PBC) were to be used by the end-user (ultimate borrower) \\u2014 National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan, OJSC \\u2014 to finance 100% of the cost of its $389,795,000 commercial (EPC) contract with Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd.

According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $77,959,000) took place on August 30, 2012 (to support a 20% advance payment to the EPC contractor), the second loan disbursement (of $5,982,563) took place on December 17, 2012 (to support a payment for the manufacturing and supply of equipment); the third loan disbursement (of $159,942,800) took place on December 31, 2013; and the fourth loan disbursement (of $100,489,000) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that, as of 2014, the loan disbursement rate was 88.3% (and total loan disbursements amounted to $344,373,400).  According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 100% as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $393,713,137.12 as of December 31, 2021.    The purpose of the project was to (a) construct a 288 km, 500kv power transmission line from Datka to Kemin and (b) construct a substation in Kemin.   TBEA was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on August 20, 2012 and the project reached completion on August 28, 2015. The official inauguration of the transmission line took place on September 1, 2015.   However, the Datka-Kemin 500kv Transmission Line Construction Project underperformed from a revenue generation and debt repayment perspective. On December 9, 2019, a Settlement Agreement was signed by Joint Stock Company \\u201cNational Grid of Kyrgyzstan\\u201d and the State Agency for Budget Credit Management under the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, overdue repayments (arrears) were included in an updated repayment schedule (amortization table) without any change to the loan\\u2019s final maturity date. According to the audited financial statement of Joint Stock Company \\u201cNational Grid of Kyrgyzstan\\u201d for the year that ended on December 31, 2019, \\u2018[t]his restructuring [\\u2026] led to significant changes in the amortized cost of loans from the Export-Import Bank of China.\\u2019 Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic signed a debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE2-029].

Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority \\u2014 an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project \\u2014 and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board\\u2019s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD\\u2019s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana\\u2019s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.  Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called \\u2018Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project\\u2019): a $75.4 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana\\u2019s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018, $78,583,000 in 2019, GHS 415,680,000 ($74,228,571) in 2020, and GHS 399,990,000 ($76,921,153) in 2021. The 2007 BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021. The 2012 BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018, $37,137,000 in 2019, GHS 269,920,000 ($48,200,000) in 2020, and GHS 274,000,000 ($52,692,307) in 2021.  The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) \\u2014 a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank \\u2014 told the country\\u2019s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG\\u2019s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank\\u2019s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.\",\"On March 23, 2010, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and IRC Limited signed a non-binding indicative term sheet in relation to the funding of 85 percent of the Phase 1 of the Kimkano & Sutarsky (K&S) Iron Mine Processing Plant Project. Then, on December 10, 2010, ICBC and Kimkano-Sutarsky Mining and Beneficiation Plant LLC (LLC KS GOK) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and wholly-owned subsidiary of IRC Limited \\u2014 signed a $340 million loan facility agreement for Phase 1 of the Kimkano & Sutarsky (K&S) Iron Mine Processing Plant Project. The loan, which is captured via Project ID#67153, carried the following borrowing terms: an 11.5 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an insurance fee of 4.61% (of the face value of the loan), and an interest rate LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin. However, according to the 2018 Annual Report from Petropavlovsk (the largest shareholder of IRC Limited), the effective interest rate of this loan facility was 6.8% in 2018 and 6.41% in 2017. The loan facility was repayable semi-annually in 16 installments of $21,250,000, beginning in December 2014 and ending in June 2022 (the final maturity date). The loan was backed by a corporate repayment guarantee from Petropavlovsk PLC \\u2014 the largest shareholder of IRC Limited \\u2014 and a Sinosure credit insurance policy. It was also secured by (i.e. collateralized against) a minimum cash deposit in an ICBC-controlled escrow (security deposit) account. The borrower had deposited $6 million in the escrow (security deposit) account as of December 31, 2011, $6 million as of December 31, 2013, and $27,250,000 as of December 31, 2014. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $400 million (HK$3.11 billion) engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that it signed with China National Electric Engineering Corporation on December 6, 2010.   On December 14, 2011, the LLC KS GOK made the first drawdown from the loan facility amounting to $6.9 million. As of December 31, 2014, IRC Limited had drawn down approximately $287,976,000 from the loan facility with another $52,024,000 left undrawn. On February 15, 2015, ICBC granted a conditional extension to the availability period of this undrawn amount by six months to June 8, 2015 and all relevant condition precedents were satisfied as of February 27, 2015. On December 14, 2011, the borrower made its first loan drawdown amounting to $6,958,000. During the first six months of 2012, the borrower made further drawdowns amounting to $75,519,000. Then, between December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, the borrower made further drawdowns amounting to $187,811,000. Additional drawdowns amounting to $93,207,000 were made by the borrower in 2014. The first installment of $21,250,000 was repaid in December 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding was $266,726,000.   There are signs that the ICBC loan underperformed vis-a-vis the lender\\u2019s original expectations. On February 27, 2017, ICBC agreed to restructure two repayment installments of the $340 million loan facility. These two rescheduled repayments of $21,250,000 were worth $42.5 million in total, and they were originally due for payment on June 20, 2017 and December 20, 2017. They were rescheduled evenly into five subsequent semi-annual repayment installments in June 20, 2018, December 20, 2018, June 20, 2019, December 20, 2019 and June 20, 2020. As a result, each of the repayment installments increased by $8.5 million to an amount equal to $29.75 million. The February 27, 2017 restructuring agreement is captured via Project ID#67157. Then, in June 2018, the loan\\u2019s corporate guarantor (Petropavlovsk PLC) announced that it would provide $29.75 million to IRC Limited to enable its wholly-owned subsidiary (LLC KS GOK) to meet a June 2018 repayment to ICBC. At the time, Petropavlovsk PLC also said that it was in \\u2018advanced\\u2019 talks with a major Russian bank to refinance the entire $340 million project loan. IRC Limited said n June 2018 that it LLC KS GOK was unable to meet payments to ICBC and that \\u2018if a missed repayment of the ICBC facility occurs, this would result in a default under the facility and would create broader problems for Petropavlovsk.\\u2019 Then, on December 18, 2018, IRC Limited entered into a facility agreement with Gazprombank (a Russian bank) worth $240 million in total. The loan facility had a maturity of March 2026 and consisted of two tranches. The principal under the first tranche amounted to $160 million with interest being charged at LIBOR plus a 5.7% margin per annum it was repayable in equal quarterly payments during the term of the Gazprombank Facility (with the final payment scheduled for December 2026). The principal under the second tranche amounted to $80 million with interest being charged at LIBOR plus a 7.7% margin per annum and it was repayable in full at the end of the loan term (December 2026). In March 2019, IRC Limited drew down $228.9 million in total from the Gazprombank Facility to fully repay the amounts outstanding under the ICBC facility (worth approximately $169 million) and the loans provided by Petropavlosk Plc (worth approximately $57 million). The remaining loan proceeds were to finance the K&S Iron Mine Processing Plant Project\\u2019s working capital needs of approximately $3 million.   The K&S Mine, 100% owned by IRC Limited, is located in the Jewish Autonomous Region (EAO) of the Russian Far East. It is the second full-scale mining and processing operation that IRC Limited has developed. K&S enjoys a geographical advantage. The Trans Siberian Railway is linked directly to the mine site, allowing or easy transport of products to customers in China. K&S is located in the Obluchenskoye District of the Jewish Autonomous Region (EAO) in the Russian Far East. The mining operation is 4 kilometers from the town of Izvestkovaya, through which the Trans Siberian Railway passes. It is also 130 kilometers from the federal highway connecting to the regional capital of Birobidzhan, and 300 kilometers from Khabarovsk, the principal city of the Russian Far East. China National Electric Engineering Co., Ltd (CNEEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation. The project was completed on August 30, 2016. \",\"On January 14, 2014, China Eximbank approved a \\u2018mixed credit\\u2019 worth approximately $6.5 billion for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. China Eximbank agreed to cover 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. This 'mixed credit' arrangement produced four different financial commitments: two preferential buyer's credits (PBC), one government concessional loan (GCL), and one buyer's credit loan (BCL). On January 14, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $382,848,800 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 50 TOTAL NO. (294)]. Its borrowing terms are unknown (captured via Project ID#92413). On February 19, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed an RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 5 TOTAL NO. (509)] carrying a 1% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and an 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41916). On December 15, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $3,618,151,200 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) and Government of Pakistan loan ID# PBC-2015-18-360] for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41918). This agreement was amended on October 8, 2019 [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) (A)], but the purpose of the amendment is unknown. Additionally, on December 18, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $2.25 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401 and BCL 2015212932] carrying a 6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41917).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent some or all of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) -- a federally funded independent governmental agency -- at a 15% interest rate. The Government of Pakistan also reportedly issued sovereign guarantees for all four China Eximbank loans that supported the project. In December 2015, the amounts outstanding under all four China Eximbank loans (worth $5.668 billion) were reportedly transferred by the Government of Pakistan to PAEC (as the direct borrower).   The purpose of the project was to construct units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), which is located in Paradise Point in Karachi within Sindh Province.  China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It is using Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 26, 2013. Then, a major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called \\u2018cold functional tests\\u2019 began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. K-2 was ultimately connected to the national grid on March 18, 2021. It was officially inaugurated on May 21, 2021 and put into operation on May 24, 2021. The K-3 reactor came online on March 4, 2022. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020.  There are some indications that the RMB 2.647 billion China Eximbank government concessional loan for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2019, PAEC sought the Prime Minister's approval to have the interest rates of the China Eximbank loans for Units 2 and 3 of the KANUPP Project reset to their original levels (when they were first issued by China Eximbank). Local sources reported at the time that the electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was set on the basis of actual electricity generation costs and on-lending at a 15% rate increased actual electricity generation costs by PKR 108 billion (necessitating an PKR 1.8/kWh increase in the tariff rate). However, it is unclear if the Prime Minister approved PAEC\\u2019s request. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-030]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, in April 2022, local media reported that the operation of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant and the repayment of the China Eximbank loans that supported its construction had become a challenge due the absence of requisite payments from the Government of Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency\\u2013Guaranteed (CPPA-G). The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2020-December 2020 is captured via Project ID#96254. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96256. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.\",\"In October 2008, China Eximbank and Kariba North Bank Extension Power Corporation Limited (KNBEPCL) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) Limited, a state-owned power company in Zambia \\u2014 signed a $315 million loan agreement for the 360MW Kariba North Bank Hydropower Plant Expansion Project. KNBEPCL is a project company and a wholly owned subsidiary of ZESCO Limited, Zambia\\u2019s state-owned power company. The China Eximbank loan to KNBEPCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity an interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was $268 million as of December 31, 2015, $240.9 million as of December 31, 2016, $214.2 million as of December 31, 2017, $214.2 million as of December 31, 2018, $160.62 million as of December 31, 2019, $133.848 million os of December 31, 2020, $120,464,052 as of June 30, 2021, and $100,002,768 (inclusive of $6,308,506 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2022.    The loan was secured by (collateralized against) receivables from Copperbelt Energy Corporation and Chambeshi Mining Company. The proceeds from this loan were used to be used by the borrower to finance an EPC contract between Sinohydro and ZESCO Limited, which was signed on November 15, 2007. Development Bank of South Africa also provided a $105 million loan for the same project. This project involved an expansion of the power generation capacity of the Kariba North hydroelectric power station through the installation of two new generators. Construction began on November 5, 2008. However, the project encountered a number of problems and delays. In 2009, a fire broke out in one of the generators. Then, in November 2011, it was reported that project completion had been delayed a year due to 'financial constraints'.   The project was ultimately completed on August 21, 2014. An official completion ceremony took place on August 27, 2014. The 1.08GW Kariba North hydroelectric power station is located on the bank of Zambezi River at Kariba in the southern province of Zambia. It includes the Kariba North Bank (KNB) (720MW) power plant and the Kariba North Bank Extension (KNBE) (360MW) power plant. The KNB power plant was developed between 1969 and 1976 as part of the Central African Power Corporation\\u2019s (CAPC) development program. The KNBE power plant consists of two 180MW vertical-shaft Francis turbines with a rated discharge 227.6m3/s operating at a head of 89m for each single unit. It has two intake chambers for water at an elevation of 458m. The underground powerhouse is 24m wide and 51m in length. The power generated is transmitted through a 130 km long, 330kV transmission line from the KNBE power plant to the existing Kafue west substation. The power generated from KNBE is purchased by ZESCO Limited under a 20-year long-term power purchase agreement (PPA), which was approved by Zambia\\u2019s Energy Regulation Board (ERB) in April 2011.\",\"On June 22, 2011, China Eximbank and the Ethiopian Railways Corporation (ERC) \\u2014 an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise \\u2014 signed a $403,750,000.(ETB 7,347,972,973) buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the Addis Ababa Light Rail Project. The borrowing terms of the loan (PBC) were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.6% margin, a 3 year grace period, and a 23 year maturity. The Government of Ethiopia provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $475 million commercial contract [ID# ET/ERC/CREC/0901] between the ERC and China Railway Group Limited (CREC), which was signed on September 3, 2009. The ERC was responsible for directly funding the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($71,250,000). Its direct contribution was payable in ETB as a down payment (with exchange rate applicable to the base date.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 42% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 6 loan disbursements (worth ETB 3,097,176.899) between 2014 and 2016: an ETB 327,586,207 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 905,511,811 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 680,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 989,898,990 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 544,700 disbursement on October 7, 2015, and an ETB 193,635,191 disbursement on April 7, 2016.   The Addis Ababa light rail metro system is a 31.6 km electrified light rail transportation system with two lines: a 17.4 kilometer east-west line and a 16.9 kilometer north-south line. The east-west line stretches from Ayat village to Tor Hailoch passing through Megenagna, Legehar and Mexico Square The north-south line passes through Menelik II Square, Merkato, Lideta, Leghar, Meskel Square, Gotera and Kaliti. The light rail metro system was designed to facilitate transportation in a city of 5 million clogged with other forms of transportation.  Each train was planned have a capacity to carry 286 passengers for a maximum capacity of 300,000 passengers/day. CREC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   The EPC contract identifies January 31, 2012 as the expected project commencement date and January 30, 2015 as the expected project completion date. It also identifies a defects liability period of one year. The project site was ultimately handed over to the EPC contractor on January 31, 2012. However, construction did not begin until April 2013. Trial operation of the railway began on February 1, 2015. The north-south line commenced operations on September 20, 2015, and the east-west line commenced operations on November 9, 2015.    According to official figures, the rail system carried on average 105,000-110,000 daily passengers during its first 14 months of operations. Tickets initially cost two to six birr ($0.08 to $0.20), depending on the distance of the trip. ERC earned $5 million in revenue from the light rail line during the Ethiopian Fiscal Year 2016/17, and by January 2017, the rail system had carried over 50 million customers. The rail system was initially supposed to be run by the Shenzhen Metro Group and CRECG until 2020. However, in 2018, the ERC was prepared to take over the operation of the railway from CRECG.   Since then, the railway has faced an array of operational performance and revenue generation problems. The Addis Ababa light rail metro system initially began operating with 40 trains, but as of 2021, it was regularly operating with approximately 20 trains. Addis Ababa\\u2019s deputy mayor has also noted that the city\\u2019s electrical grid lacked the capacity to power the system before construction began. Even with its own dedicated power supply, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system still experiences power outages and delays, leading to packed cars and poor service. Additionally, in 2021, Ethiopia\\u2019s Office of the Auditor General found that, during its first four years in operation, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system generated $11.1 million of revenue but cost $154 million to operate. It found that the system was falling far short of its original feasibility study, which said it would pay for its construction costs within 10 years through ticket sales, advertising and renting out spaces in stations, among other methods: '[t]he feasibility study has been inadequate, and it was conducted without collecting enough information. [\\u2026] This, coupled with the absence of a maintenance center to fix the trains that need repair and other factors, have contributed to the losses sustained by the light railway.'  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Addis Ababa Light Rail Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Ethiopia\\u2019s Office of the Auditor General also found in 2021 that the ERC had fallen into arrears and paid $2.8 million in fines to China Eximbank for overdue loan repayments related to the Addis Ababa Light Rail Project. Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On January 18, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $327,740,000 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2008) 1 TOTAL NO. (41) and ID#320080001] for the Karakoram Highway Improvement (Raikot-Khunjerab Section) Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 12 year maturity, a 3% interest rate, and unknown grace period.   This project, which is also known as the Karakoram Highway (KKH) Upgrade Project, involved the upgrading of a 335 km segment of the Karakoram Highway runs from Raikot to Khunjerab. This segment was widened from 10 to 30 meters, making it suitable for heavy and long vehicles and allowing it to remain functional throughout the year. The project also involved the construction of 32 new bridges and rehabilitate 27 existing bridges. Its total cost was $491 million.   China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) and the Pakistan National Highway Authority (NHA) were responsible for implementation of the project. National Engineering Services Pakistan (Nespak) served as a consultant for the project.  A groundbreaking ceremony was held on February 16, 2008. Construction began on August 1, 2008. The project was successfully completed on November 30, 2013. The road work was designed and constructed in accordance with China\\u2019s three-level highway standard. Final inspection of the project was was carried out by NHA's Inspection Wing.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer\\u2019s credit loan for the Karakoram Highway Improvement (Raikot-Khunjerab Section) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the Karakoram Highway Improvement (Raikot-Khunjerab Section) Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-036]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the Karakoram Highway Improvement (Raikot-Khunjerab Section) Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the Karakoram Highway Improvement (Raikot-Khunjerab Section) Project. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2020-December 2020 is captured via Project ID#96254. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96251. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.\",\"On May 22, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $448 million buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID# CN-BCL-2013-01 and 2012211330] for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#35266). The borrowing terms of the 2013 BCL were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 8 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin, a 0.75% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. Then, on September 29, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a second BCL agreement [ID# 2016211190] worth $576 million for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#54087). The borrowing terms of the 2016 BCL were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 8 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin, a 0.75% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. Both BCLs were to be repaid and secured with cash (from surcharges on electricity) deposited in an escrow account known as the Neelum-Jhelum Hydro Power Development Fund. As of December 28, 2018, the cash balance of the escrow account was approximately $10,760,508 (PKR 1.49 billion).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent the proceeds of the BCLs (at a 12% interest rate) to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC), which is a project company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) that was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project. As of June 30 2017, the $576 million BCL had fully disbursed and the $448 million BCL had achieved a 42.6% disbursement rate ($191.067 million out of $448 million).  According to a March 2018 tariff petition that NJHPC submitted to Pakistan\\u2019s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of 506,579 million Pakistani rupees (PKR) was to be financed according to a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total amount of debt financing amounted to PKR 401,416 million, which is roughly equivalent to $3.823 billion. Additional foreign sources of debt financing included $358 million from the Islamic Development Bank, $181 million from the Saudi Fund for Development, $81 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development, and $74 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development.  The 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project is a run-of-the-river project in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The power plant has four power generation units and it was designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri, 41 km northeast of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse was constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 km south of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 km south of ChatterKalas. Upon completion, the project was expected to produce 5.15 billion units of electricity annually.  The EPC contractor for this project was a Chinese consortium known as CGGC-CMEC that consisted of China Gezhouba Group Co., Ltd. (CGGC) and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMEC). In January 2008, a letter of commencement was issued to the EPC contractor. The implementation of the project began on February 9, 2008 and construction activities were originally expected to reach completion by October 2016. According to WAPDA, 90% of the construction works were completed by March 2018. The project was officially completed on April 13, 2018. The Neelum-Jhelum power plant delivered 590 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from unit three on July 4, 2018, 453 GWh from unit four on October 4, 2018, 331 GWh from unit two on August 27, 2018 and 314 GWh from unit one on December 28, 2018. The project was originally expected to achieve its commercial operations date (COD) by December 2018. However, it is unclear if the project achieved this goal. As of February 2021, Pakistan\\u2019s Ministry of Water Resources had still not officially communicated the final COD to the Power Division. By April 11, 2019, the project had injected 2,400 GWh of energy into the national grid.  This project was plagued by controversy. In a performance audit of the project that Pakistan\\u2019s Auditor General (AG) submitted to the parliament in February 2019, the AG concluded that \\u2018NJHP is an exemplary mismanaged project resulting into heavy cost and time overrun.\\u2019 The audit reported an \\u2018unjustified abnormal cost overrun of [PKR 389 billion]\\u2019 and losses due to non-achievement of envisaged financial benefits of PKR 237 billion. It also reported losses of PKR 30 billion of revenue and an unjustified claim of PKR 175 million rock burst and an unjustified and uneconomical deployment of tunnel boring machine that failed to achieve envisaged benefits of PKR 23.15 billion. The audit also pointed to the irregular and unjustified award of construction of contract of PKR 90.90 billion before the appointment of consultants and non-obtaining of performance guarantees worth PKR 48.8 billion resulting into suspension of foreign loans and delay in the project. Also, the AG highlighted poor performance of consultants for the project engaged at the cost of PKR 16 billion and non-recovery of PKR 9.90 billion as liquidity damages from the contractors. Other problems identified by the audit include non-achievement of financial close till the project completion, delays in land acquisition, delays in adequate power supply, frequent major design changes, non-finalization of detailed engineering design, and frequent issuance of variation orders. Transparency International Pakistan also alleged that the procurement of tunnel-boring machines (TBM), which were meant to speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels, resulted in $74 million in kickbacks.   Then, in November 2019, NJHPC CEO Mohammad Zareen testified before Pakistan's National Assembly Standing Committee on Planning and Development and noted that '[i]f revenue from the Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) does not commence by December 2019, the NJHPC/Wapda/GoP shall go into default due to back-to-back guarantee, apart from the NJHPC not meeting the routine maintenance expense.' Mohammad Zareen also testified that CGGC-CMEC abandoned the project after it had achieved a 99.6% completion rate and after shelling by the Indian Army at the dam site in July 2019 and October 2019. He said the Chinese contractor was not willing to return. Mohammad  Zareen said the company\\u2019s annual debt service liability amounted to Rs 50 billion and it was getting regular letters from the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) every month for the servicing of debt to external lenders. 'I will not have the funds to pay even for salaries after December [2019]', he said, adding that the Rs 100 billion raised from local banks was currently being utilized for debt servicing and salaries.  He also noted that Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) CPPA had not signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with NJHPC: 'The PPA between the CPPA-G and the NJHPC, drafted and cleared by the legal section of the CPPA in June 2019, was submitted to the CPPA in July 2019 for approval of invoicing of payment of energy delivered, but is not being approved.' Consequently, NJHPC was not paid for energy delivered through the end of 2019. The non-signing of the PPA between the CPPA and NJHPC resulted in a circular debt build-up of about Rs 75 billion.  On July 4, 2022, when the power plant was running at its full capacity (969MW), an abnormal increase in water leakage was observed which was controlled through continuous drainage pumps and an investigation into the excessive leakage was started. On July 5, 2022, an emergency meeting was held between the project management and the project consultants team to analyze the situation and determine the root cause of excessive water leakage. It was observed that tailrace tunnel had obtained an abnormal pressure of 616m instead of the normal 600m. It was also pointed out by the project consultants that abnormal pressure of 616m in the TRT (tailrace tunnel) had been recorded which otherwise remained below 600 meter. Accordingly, to ascertain behaviour of TRT, one unit was shut down which resulted in decrease in pressure to 608m. The consultants recommended that TRT pressure should be below 604m. In this way, load was reduced gradually. Then, on July 6, 2022, it was determined that the abnormal increase in pressure and water leakages/seepage was due to blockage in TRT and considering the safety of the structure and all other equipment, the power house was shut down. Soon afterwards and after necessary preparation (lowering of bulkhead gates by Mobile Crane, functional check of dewatering pumps etc.), dewatering was started on July 10, 2022. After completion of dewatering up to the main collapse point (293m), an inspection of the tunnel was carried out. According to the findings of a report, 'It was found that tunnel is fully blocked in 42m portion (between 251m and 293m) besides other damages.' Upon submission of the report to the Prime Minister's Office, a meeting was held on July 13., 2022 in which the Prime Minister instructed the government to engage a foreign consulting firm for determine the causes of the defect and seek advice on the remedial works. A detailed ToR for consulting firms was issued by the Prime Minister's Office, which was later finalized by the inter-ministerial committee at a meeting held on July 26, 2022. Immediately after the incident, CGGC was engaged for carrying out repairs. The contractor started mobilization at the site and subsequently a contract agreement was signed with the firm on August 25, 2022. Work on the restoration of plant commenced shortly thereafter. However, in September 2022, Chinese engineers and staff reportedly abandoned the repair of the 969 MW Neelum-Jhelum hydropower facility, which faced issues related to substantial cracks in a tunnel, resulting in a shutdown of the power plant coinciding with a power crisis in the country.  The Chinese workers were reportedly facing security issues with local residents. The Government of Pakistan, at the time, rejected claims that work has stopped at the project site.\",\"On January 12, 2011, China Eximbank signed a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No.(2011) 1 TOTAL NO.(152) No. 1420303052011210025] with the Republic of Cameroon worth $423,000,000 USD for Phase 1 of Kribi Deep Sea Port Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 7 year grace period, a 20 year maturity, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a revenue account to facilitate repayment. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($497,468,255) of a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy. The Republic of Cameroon originally agreed to cover the remaining 15% of the project cost, but it later renegotiated and reportedly did not pay for this component of the project.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. The loan\\u2019s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 191.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.    The purpose of the project was undertake the first phase of the construct of a deep seaport in the Atlantic coast town of Kribi, 300 km south of Yaounde. Upon completion, the main port was expected to receive large vessels with a capacity close to 100,000 tons.  Construction began on January 10, 2010, and an official groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 8, 2011. The project was completed on April 6, 2015.   Project ID#350 captures the China Eximbank PBC for Phase 1 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project. China Eximbank also provided financing for Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project via a GCL (as captured via Project ID#53116) as well as a PBC (as captured via Project ID#53396).   Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project was completed on March 2, 2018.  Following a call for tenders, the right to manage the container terminal of the port was awarded to a consortium made up of CHEC and two French companies, Bollor\\u00e9 and CMA CGM, while the right to operate the multipurpose terminal went to the consortium of the French Necotrans and the Cameroonian Kribi Port Multi Operators (KPMO).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the first and second phases of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon \\u2014 with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 \\u2014 by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) \\u2014 or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon\\u2019s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini \\u00e0 Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.\\u2019\",\"On November 8, 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $349,000,000 preferential buyer credit (PBC) agreement for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project. On November 26, 2009, the Ethiopian parliament ratified the loan under proclamation No. 658/2009. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) and China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC), which was signed on or around June 27, 2009.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $349 million PBC achieved a 60% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 16 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,847,852,378) between 2011 and 2017: an ETB 651,221,131 disbursement on January 8, 2011, an ETB 682,158,333 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 236,792,990 disbursement on October 10, 2011, an ETB 273,157,439 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 450,455,536 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 216,893,784 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 853,439,518 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 996,656,460 disbursement on July 7, 2013, an ETB 236,742,424 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 130,076,628 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 984,252 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 808,081 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 491,459 disbursement on July 7, 2015, an ETB 282,589 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 33,385,378 disbursement on October 7, 2016, and an ETB 84,306,376 disbursement on July 7, 2017.    Then, on September 10, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $333 million preferential buyer credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC N). 2013 (35) Total No. (279) 1420303052013211786] for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate, and a 0.25% administration fee (management fee). The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 75% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between ERA and CCCC, which was signed on January 22, 2014. $143 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID#30886), and $190 million of the loan proceeds were allocated to Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project (captured via Project ID #36251).   As of March 16, 2021, the $332 million PBC had achieved a 92% disbursement rate ($306,388,654.06 of $333 million). According to official correspondence between the Concessional Loan Department of China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Ethiopia (on March 18, 2021), China Eximbank made 16 loan disbursements (worth $306,388,654.06) through the $333 million PBC between 2014 and 2021: a $100,707,143.90 disbursement on June 26 2014, a $40,941,780.28 disbursement on November 27, 2014, a $25,384,969.23 disbursement on December 22, 2014, a $15,133,515.73 disbursement on June 12, 2015, a $24,221,555.29 disbursement on June 23, 2015, a $8,858,069.08 disbursement on September 22, 2015, a $12,870,031.74 disbursement on October 23, 2015, a $21,763,228.43 disbursement on February, 29, 2016, a $15,093,235.16 disbursement on August 19, 2016, a $15,901,936.27 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a $3,617,707.32 disbursement on June 14, 2017, a $3,317,569.64 disbursement on June 22, 2017, a $4,129,676.75 disbursement on June 23, 2017, a $5,861,882.71 disbursement on December 24, 2019, a $8,338,128.14 disbursement on March 15, 2021, and a $248,224.39 disbursement on March 16, 2021. The total estimated cost of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was $612 million.   The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama. The alignment starts from Tulu Dimtu. The main road of the expressway continues 2.8 km along the proposed Addis Adaba outer ring road and then crosses Dukem, Bishoftu and Modjo on their east side. It then passes the old Addis Adama road at 62km and bypasses around Adama on the south side. The expressway ends on the east side of Adama and connects to Adama Awash road. The expressway has 18 km of link road and 7.2 km of frontage road on either side in Adama. The road work involved the construction of six interchanges, three intersections, 77 slab culverts, 36 underpasses and 43 overpasses. The 5.4m-high overpasses are supported by 73t girders, reinforced concrete piers and stone structures. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles and cars can use three of the underpasses. The underpass for agricultural vehicles has a width of 4.5m and a height of 3.2m. The pedestrian underpass is 4.5m wide and 2.2m high. Car underpasses are larger in size with 6.5m width and 4.5m height. Flood discharge was used to size the culverts, which was designed according to velocity, water scouring and water levels. The project also included the construction of two main toll gates and 13 ramp toll gates.   The ultimate objective of the project was to reduce the travel time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project also sought to lay the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. Upon completion, the project was expected to contribute to the development of roadways between the capital city and other regions, such as Hawassa and Bale.    The Addis-Adama Expressway (AAE) is fully access-controlled and managed by Ethiopian Toll Road Enterprise (ETRE). CCCC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project\\u2019s first phase and second phase. Phase 1 construction began on April 21, 2010.  According to Samson Wondimu, the Communication Director of ERA, the project\\u2019s first phase had achieved a 33.6% completion rate as of April 2012. By September 2012, it had achieved a 50% completion rate. A completion ceremony for the first phase of the project was held on May 5, 2014. The second phase of the project (also known as the Lebu-Akaki-Information Technology Park Outer Ring Road Project, the Lebu-Akaki IT Park Outer Ring Road Project, and the Akaki-Goro and Akaki-Lebu Road Project) involved the construction of a 28.1 km toll road \\u2014 with three lanes each 3.5 meters wide \\u2014 that links Adama Town in Oromia State with Addis Ababa. Phase 2 supported two road sections: a 14.6 km Akaki-ICT Park (Goro) road section and a 13.6 km Akaki-Lebu road section. Phase 2 also involved the construction of six bridges, one railway line interchange, and three interchanges at Tulu Dimitu, Akaki and Lebu. Upon completion, the project\\u2019s second phase was expected to ease traffic congestion along the Akaki-Bishoftu corridor. Phase 2 began implementation on May 5, 2014 and was originally scheduled to reach completion within 25 months (June 5, 2016). By November 27, 2014, the second phase of the project had achieved a 27% completion rate. By June 2015, the second phase of the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Phase 2 was ultimately completed on August 6, 2016.   After the completion of first and second phases of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, traffic volumes on the expressway reportedly exceeded 20,000 vehicles per day on the two-lane road trunk road between Addis Ababa and Adama. In October 2019, an official from the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprise (ETRE) reported that around 33 million cars had used the toll expressway over the previous five years, generating around $34 million of revenue for the country. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[a]fter 5 years [the expressway] has earned back only about $30 million in toll revenue, well short of expectations. Ethiopia built the toll road parallel to an existing free highway, and a lot of the traffic has remained on the old road.\\u2019  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On September 25, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement worth $293,506,062 for the Bui Dam Construction Project. Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority \\u2014 an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project \\u2014 and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board\\u2019s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD\\u2019s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana\\u2019s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.  Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called \\u2018Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project\\u2019): a $75.4 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana\\u2019s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018, $78,583,000 in 2019, GHS 415,680,000 ($74,228,571) in 2020, and GHS 399,990,000 ($76,921,153) in 2021. The 2007 BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021. The 2012 BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018, $37,137,000 in 2019, GHS 269,920,000 ($48,200,000) in 2020, and GHS 274,000,000 ($52,692,307) in 2021.  The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) \\u2014 a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank \\u2014 told the country\\u2019s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG\\u2019s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank\\u2019s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.\",\"In May 2007, Karot Power Company Limited (KPCL) obtained a letter of interest from Pakistan\\u2019s Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB) to develop the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project. KPCL is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that was created for the purpose of financing, building, operating and maintaining the 720 MW run-of-the-river Karot hydropower plant on the Jhelum River in Pakistan. China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited (C-SAIL)\\u2014an investment holding company formed by China Three Gorges Corporation on September 30, 2011 in the Cayman Islands, to acquire, develop, build, own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan\\u2014holds a 93% ownership stake in KPCL, while Pakistan's Associated Technologies holds a 7% ownership stake in KPCL.   In October 2009, PPIB approved a feasibility study report for the 720MW Karot hydropower project and Pakistan\\u2019s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) granted KPCL a generation license to develop the project on November 2013. Then, on September 9, 2016, KPCL and the Central Power Purchasing Agency\\u2013Guarantee (CPPA-G) signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the Karot Hydropower Project.   On February 22, 2017, China Development Bank (CDB), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), and the Silk Road Fund (SRF) signed a $1.292 billion syndicated buyer's credit (loan) agreement with Karot Power Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (KPCL) for the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#37233). The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a maturity of 17 years, a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.75% margin, a 1% arrangement (management), and a 0.5% commitment fee. The borrower is expected to make equal, semi-annual repayments on April 21 and October 21 of each year during the loan's repayment period.  The total cost of the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project, excluding contingencies, was $1.74 billion and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The World Bank Group\\u2019s International Finance Corporation (IFC) issued a $100 million loan in support of the project on November 25, 2016. The remaining $1.292 billion of debt financing was provided by this syndicate of Chinese state-owned lenders. CDB's contribution is captured via Project ID#37233. China Eximbank's contribution is captured in Project ID#92310. The Silk Road Fund's contribution is captured via Project ID#92311.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $1.6 billion commercial (EPC) contract with Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd. (TGDC). Sinosure also issued a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy at a cost of $54.3 million, and the borrower pledged the following sources of collateral to the lending syndicate: fixed (project) assets, future rights to electricity charges, and the Sinosure credit insurance policy. Additionally, China Three Gorges Corporation reportedly made a $316.20 million equity investment in project, while Associated Technologies reportedly made a $23.90 million equity investment (captured via Project ID#54012).  The purpose of the independent power project (IPP) is to construct a 720MW hydropower generation complex \\u2014 with four, 180MW power generation units \\u2014 near Karot village, some 1.7 kilometers upstream of Karot Bridge and 74 km upstream of Mangla Dam. The project involves the construction of a roc-filled dam, spillway, powerhouse, diversion tunnels, head-race power tunnels and a tail-race tunnel end. The project site is accessible through the Islamabad \\u2013 Kahuta \\u2013 Kotli road, approximately 29 kilometers from Kahuta, and 65 kilometers from Islamabad. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2,970 GWh (net) of clean energy annually and reduce 2.3 million tons of carbon emissions each year. The IPP is being implemented on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis. KPCL will sell all its energy to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC) under a 30-year power purchase agreement [at a levelized tariff of Rs 7.68 (7.57 cents) per unit]. The Government of Pakistan GoP guaranteed the (power purchase) payment obligations of the NTDC to the KPCL.  The Government of Pakistan also issued a 17% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.   The general EPC contractor responsible for implementation is Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC). China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is also involved in implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 20, 2015. A construction mobilization ceremony was held on January 10, 2016. A project implementation agreement was signed on September 28, 2016. Then, a \\u201cnotice to proceed\\\" was issued to (TGDC) on December 1, 2016. Construction works were 25% complete as of September 2017. On September 22, 2018, the project successfully achieved river closure. Construction works were 70% complete as of January 2020. Then, on May 2, 2021, the first rotor of the power plant was successfully hoisted into place. Construction works were 88% complete as of May 2021. On November 20, 2021, the hydropower station closed the gates of its diversion tunnels and started water storage in its reservoir for future use. To date, the project has reportedly employed 3000-5000 people. The originally expected commercial operation date (COD) of the hydropower plant was December 28, 2021. KPCL is responsible for handing over this project to the Pakistani government after the term of its 30-year concession agreement has expired.  The project has been the subject of local controversy. In August 2019, a complaint was submitted to the IFC\\u2019s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) by a former employee of the project. The complaint raised concerns about lack of payment of exit wages, as well as discrimination against local workers in relation to access to drinking water, conditions of accommodations and transportation at the project site. Then, in July 2020, a complaint was lodged with CAO by representatives of Building and Wood Workers International (BWI) and the Pakistan Federation of Building and Wood Workers (PFBWW), on behalf of the Awami Labor Union. The complaint raises a range of social issues related to the working conditions and terms of employment, workers' organizations, and grievance redress mechanism at the Karot hydropower plant. The complainants claimed adverse impacts on approximately 3,000 project workers, including violations of IFC Performance Standard 2 on workers\\u2019 organizations, health and safety, working conditions and terms of employment, grievance mechanisms, retrenchment, and concerns related to the use of security forces under IFC Performance Standard 4.  There are also some indications that the syndicated loan for the 720MW Karot Hydropower Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. In March 2023, KPCL sought Rs 22.703 billion from Central Power Purchasing Agency\\u2013Guarantee (CPPA-G) by April 10, 2023 to settle its outstanding debts (including principal and interest) to SRF, CDB, China Eximbank, and IFC and avoid default.  In a letter to Rehan Akhtar, the CEO of CPPA-G, KPCL\\u2019s CEO Wang Minsheng noted that his company had to make mandatory principal, interest, and commitment fee payments and any delays in payment would result in a breach of covenants resulting in an event of default for the company.  He noted that, per section 2.05 of the facility agreements signed by KPCL and its lenders, his company needed to make its second loan repayment (equivalent to 3.31 percent of the outstanding loan amount, or Rs. 22.703 billion) by April 21, 2023. KPCL therefore requested that CPPA-G pay its overdue invoices (receivables) -- worth Rs 4.937 billion -- by April 10, 2023. At the time, invoices were being submitted based on a reference tariff without indexation determined by NEPRA on the actual costs incurred by KPCL at the time of Commercial Operation Date (COD) stage tariff.\",\"In May 2007, Karot Power Company Limited (KPCL) obtained a letter of interest from Pakistan\\u2019s Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB) to develop the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project. KPCL is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that was created for the purpose of financing, building, operating and maintaining the 720 MW run-of-the-river Karot hydropower plant on the Jhelum River in Pakistan. China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited (C-SAIL)\\u2014an investment holding company formed by China Three Gorges Corporation on September 30, 2011 in the Cayman Islands, to acquire, develop, build, own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan\\u2014holds a 93% ownership stake in KPCL, while Pakistan's Associated Technologies holds a 7% ownership stake in KPCL.   In October 2009, PPIB approved a feasibility study report for the 720MW Karot hydropower project and Pakistan\\u2019s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) granted KPCL a generation license to develop the project on November 2013. Then, on September 9, 2016, KPCL and the Central Power Purchasing Agency\\u2013Guarantee (CPPA-G) signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the Karot Hydropower Project.   On February 22, 2017, China Development Bank (CDB), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), and the Silk Road Fund (SRF) signed a $1.292 billion syndicated buyer's credit (loan) agreement with Karot Power Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (KPCL) for the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#37233). The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a maturity of 17 years, a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.75% margin, a 1% arrangement (management), and a 0.5% commitment fee. The borrower is expected to make equal, semi-annual repayments on April 21 and October 21 of each year during the loan's repayment period.  The total cost of the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project, excluding contingencies, was $1.74 billion and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The World Bank Group\\u2019s International Finance Corporation (IFC) issued a $100 million loan in support of the project on November 25, 2016. The remaining $1.292 billion of debt financing was provided by this syndicate of Chinese state-owned lenders. CDB's contribution is captured via Project ID#37233. China Eximbank's contribution is captured in Project ID#92310. The Silk Road Fund's contribution is captured via Project ID#92311.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $1.6 billion commercial (EPC) contract with Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd. (TGDC). Sinosure also issued a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy at a cost of $54.3 million, and the borrower pledged the following sources of collateral to the lending syndicate: fixed (project) assets, future rights to electricity charges, and the Sinosure credit insurance policy. Additionally, China Three Gorges Corporation reportedly made a $316.20 million equity investment in project, while Associated Technologies reportedly made a $23.90 million equity investment (captured via Project ID#54012).  The purpose of the independent power project (IPP) is to construct a 720MW hydropower generation complex \\u2014 with four, 180MW power generation units \\u2014 near Karot village, some 1.7 kilometers upstream of Karot Bridge and 74 km upstream of Mangla Dam. The project involves the construction of a roc-filled dam, spillway, powerhouse, diversion tunnels, head-race power tunnels and a tail-race tunnel end. The project site is accessible through the Islamabad \\u2013 Kahuta \\u2013 Kotli road, approximately 29 kilometers from Kahuta, and 65 kilometers from Islamabad. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2,970 GWh (net) of clean energy annually and reduce 2.3 million tons of carbon emissions each year. The IPP is being implemented on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis. KPCL will sell all its energy to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC) under a 30-year power purchase agreement [at a levelized tariff of Rs 7.68 (7.57 cents) per unit]. The Government of Pakistan GoP guaranteed the (power purchase) payment obligations of the NTDC to the KPCL.  The Government of Pakistan also issued a 17% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.   The general EPC contractor responsible for implementation is Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC). China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is also involved in implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 20, 2015. A construction mobilization ceremony was held on January 10, 2016. A project implementation agreement was signed on September 28, 2016. Then, a \\u201cnotice to proceed\\\" was issued to (TGDC) on December 1, 2016. Construction works were 25% complete as of September 2017. On September 22, 2018, the project successfully achieved river closure. Construction works were 70% complete as of January 2020. Then, on May 2, 2021, the first rotor of the power plant was successfully hoisted into place. Construction works were 88% complete as of May 2021. On November 20, 2021, the hydropower station closed the gates of its diversion tunnels and started water storage in its reservoir for future use. To date, the project has reportedly employed 3000-5000 people. The originally expected commercial operation date (COD) of the hydropower plant was December 28, 2021. KPCL is responsible for handing over this project to the Pakistani government after the term of its 30-year concession agreement has expired.  The project has been the subject of local controversy. In August 2019, a complaint was submitted to the IFC\\u2019s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) by a former employee of the project. The complaint raised concerns about lack of payment of exit wages, as well as discrimination against local workers in relation to access to drinking water, conditions of accommodations and transportation at the project site. Then, in July 2020, a complaint was lodged with CAO by representatives of Building and Wood Workers International (BWI) and the Pakistan Federation of Building and Wood Workers (PFBWW), on behalf of the Awami Labor Union. The complaint raises a range of social issues related to the working conditions and terms of employment, workers' organizations, and grievance redress mechanism at the Karot hydropower plant. The complainants claimed adverse impacts on approximately 3,000 project workers, including violations of IFC Performance Standard 2 on workers\\u2019 organizations, health and safety, working conditions and terms of employment, grievance mechanisms, retrenchment, and concerns related to the use of security forces under IFC Performance Standard 4.

The face value of the BCL was subsequently downsized to $484,668,867.74. The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a variable interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin, a 3 year grace period, a 15 year maturity, a 0.75% commitment fee, a 0.75% management fee, and a 7.01% Sinosure insurance premium.   The proceeds of the BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $599,097,509 commercial contract [ID# 035-2013] between Harbin Electric Company Limited and the Corporaci\\u00f3n El\\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador (CELEC E.P.), which was signed on July 26, 2013. $203,515,143.67 had been disbursed through the BCL as of July 2018.

The purpose of the project was to evacuate electricity from the Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric power plant and the Sopladora hydroelectric power plant, both of which were constructed with financial support from China Eximbank (captured via Project ID#38935 and Project ID#35818). The project had four objectives: (1) construction of a 500kV transmission line that runs from the Coca Codo Sinclair substation to the San Rafael substation and the El Inga substation in Quito within Pichincha province; (2) construction of a 500kV transmission line that runs from the Chorrillos substation (in Guayaquil within Guayas province) to the Tisaleo substation (in Tungurahua province) and the El Inga substation in Quito; (3) construction of a 230kV transmission line that runs from the Blower substation to the Taday substation and the Taura substation; and (4) construction of a 230kV transmission line that runs from the San Rafael substation to the Jivino substation and the Shushufindi substation.   Harbin Electric Company Limited was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced in 2013 but was temporarily halted in May 2016. During the project\\u2019s peak construction period, it generated 4,200 local jobs. The project was officially completed on June 13, 2019. A temporary project handover certificate was issued on November 22, 2019. A final project handover certificate was issued on November 20, 2020. However, the China Eximbank loan (BCL) that supported this project has underperformed. It was rescheduled twice \\u2014 once in September 2020 (as captured via Project ID#91361) and again in September 2022 (as captured via Project ID#96293).\",\"In March 2006, the Government of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed an MoU for various projects proposed by the Government of Tajikistan. Then, on December 21, 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $267,219,451 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan for the 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2%.    The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds of the PBC to on-lend (through subsidiary loan agreement (No. BLA06015, #6015) to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d -- a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy -- at a 3% interest rate between December 21, 2006 and June 21, 2026.  OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 95% of the cost of a $281.3 million commercial contract with TBEA Co., Ltd.   The loan's amount outstanding was TJS 2,104,674,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 2,356,608,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 2,519,773,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 2,588,608,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 2,975,163,000 as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 500 kV electricity transmission line that would connect the northern Sughd region to the national grid. The project also expected to facilitate the effective dispatching of electricity between Dushanbe and Khujand, completely solve the problem of power shortage in the south during the dry season in winter, build a transmission channel for the implementation of the Tajik Hydropower Strategy, improve the safety, stability, and reliability of the power grid, and reduce the loss of electricity through transmission from 14% to 3.2%.   TBEA Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on September 16, 2006 and the North-South transmission line has been operational since November 29, 2009.  Construction of the 325 km, 500 kV south\\u2013north power transmission line reportedly enabled Tajikistan to become independent of the Uzbek power transmission network and to distribute electricity throughout the country.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a 2021 IMF report, \\u2018[OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d] has significant arrears to the government on [foreign exchange] denominated loans. The government on-lends concessional [foreign exchange] loans [\\u2026] from multilateral and bilateral agencies to [OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d] on non-concessional terms. These loans are denominated in [foreign exchange] and are intended to develop the energy infrastructure. However, these debts are not serviced fully, resulting in [foreign exchange] arrears to the government.\\u2019 A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) elaborated on this point, explaining that \\u2018[a] high rate of uncollected payments for electricity use due to illegal connections, power theft and outdated metering infrastructure contribute to the worsening financial health of Barki Tojik.\\u2019 Then, in March 2023, the IMF published a report, which noted that \\u2018[I]n 2021 the SOE sector [\\u2026] kept accumulating debt service losses, where within a year the amount of debt overdue payments [\\u2026] increased from TJS 14 billion to TJS 17 billion (17.1 percent of GDP). Some 93 percent of accumulated overdue debt belongs to [OHSHC \\u201cBarqi Tojik\\u201d].\\u2019\",\"On December 30, 2007, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $306,726,736 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [BLA0704] for Phase I of the Hambantota Port Development Project. The original borrowing terms of the BCL (captured via Project ID#33256) are as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 0.75% margin, a 15 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, and a 6% Sinosure insurance premium (exposure fee) that was to be paid in two equal installments within two years of the loan agreement signature date. The BCL agreement also specifies that 'in case of arrears on interest payments, the borrower is expected to pay interest on those arrears at an annualized rate equivalent to the interest rate on the respective loan. In case of arrears on interest and principal, then the borrower is expected to pay interest on those arrears at an annualized rate equivalent to the interest rate on the respective loan plus one percent.'   The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of the BCL to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka.  China Eximbank disbursed an unknown amount in 2007, an unknown amount in 2008, $153,430,619.03 (Rs. 17,634,548,199) in 2009, $114,859,550.41 (Rs. 12,987,651,775) in 2010, $2,929,597.02 (Rs. 323,888,923) in 2011, and $31,944,655.03 in 2012. The loan's amount outstanding was $248,349,992.17 (Rs. 32,073,358,419) as of December 31, 2013, $223,073,990 as of December 31, 2016 and $69,710,622 as of June 30, 2022.  At the time the loan was contracted, its all-in interest rate was 5.234%. However, at the beginning of the project implementation period, LIBOR increased, pushing up the all-in interest rate to 6.5%. The Government of Sri Lanka and China Eximbank restructured the BCL agreement in October 2008, replacing the loan\\u2019s variable interest rate with a fixed interest rate of 6.3% (as captured via Project ID#85184).  Phase I of the Hambantota Port Development Project involved the construction of two breakwaters (312m long eastern b/w and 988m long western b/w), a 17m deep harbor basin, a 210m wide entrance channel, a service berth, a 100,000DWT general purpose berth, a 100,000 DWT oil berth, and various roads and buildings (including an administrative building, a public service building and utility buildings). China Harbor Engineering Co. and Sinohydro were the contractors responsible for project implementation. Construction of the port commenced on January 15, 2008. The first phase of the port was ceremonially opened on November 18, 2010, with the berthing of the naval ship \\u2018Jetliner\\u2019 at the port facilities. November 18, 2010 also marked the date of the President\\u2019s birthday and the beginning of Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP). However, the project was not officially completed until October 30, 2011.  Phases I and II of HPDP have encountered financial management problems and corruption allegations. Hambantota Port generated lower-than-expected container traffic and proved to be commercially nonviable under SLPA ownership. Consequently, SLPA could not service its loans to China Eximbank. In response, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) \\u2014 a subsidiary of China Merchants Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) \\u2014 purchased a majority ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years.  More specifically, on July 29, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, and Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) signed a 99-year concession agreement and formed a joint venture to operate Hambantota Port. According to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CMPort acquired an 85% stake in Hambantota International Ports Group (HIPG) and a 49.3% stake in Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), representing about 70% of the total equity. CMPort was also granted the operating and management rights of HIPG and HIPS as well as the lease and development rights of approximately 11.5 square kilometers of land in the Hambantota port area. CMPort agreed to make a total equity investment of $1.12 billion, of which $974 million would be used to acquire the 85% stake in HIPG and $146 million would be deposited into a bank account in the name of CMPort in Sri Lanka (for the expansion of Hambantota Port and shipping-related business).  According to a July 20, 2017 Cabinet Memorandum entitled \\u2018Hambantota Port Concession Agreement\\u2019 (No. MPS/SEC/2017/32) that was approved by Sri Lanka\\u2019s Cabinet on August 4, 2017, when the concession agreement was signed, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans that were contracted for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred from SLPA to the General Treasury. Given that the General Treasury was also identified of the recipient of the $974 million cash infusion from CMPort, many media outlets and commentators reported that the arrangement represented a debt-for-equity swap.  Another source of controversy arose in June 2018 when the New York Times reported that $7.6 million had been transferred from a Standard Chartered Bank account controlled by China Harbor Engineering Co. (labelled \\u2018HPDP Phase 2\\u2019) to affiliates of President Rajapaksa\\u2019s re-election campaign. The New York Times also reported that checks worth $1.2 million (linked to the \\u2018HPDP Phase 2\\u2019 bank account) were delivered to President Rajapaksa\\u2019s official residence.\",\"On May 4, 2014, China Eximbank and the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation (ESC) \\u2014 an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise \\u2014 signed a $500 million (ETB 9,727,626,459) loan agreement for the Welkait Sugar Mill Project. The Ethiopian Government issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus as 3% margin, a 14 year maturity, and 4 year grace period. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a $647 million commercial (EPC) contract between ESC and China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd. (CAMCE), which was signed on June 10, 2013.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $500 million (ETB 9,727,626,459) loan for the Welkait Sugar Mill Project achieved a 114% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 44 loan disbursements (worth ETB 11,118,858,284) between 2015 and 2020: an ETB 554,010,424 disbursement on December 25, 2015, an ETB 1,786,218,847 disbursement on May 18, 2016, an ETB 448,903,299 disbursement on December 23, 2016, an ETB 28,238,854 disbursement on December 23, 2016, an ETB 124,292,734 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 138,110,858 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 35,899,704 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 92,355,665 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 296,084,581 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 242,822,856 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 26,193,982 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 20,337,902 disbursement on May 25, 2017, an ETB 164,283,295 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 271,695,163 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 106,574,404 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 278,058,734 disbursement on June 21, 2017, an ETB 355,556,821 disbursement on June 21, 2017, an ETB 331,393,450 disbursement on June 21, 2017, an ETB 19,022,653 disbursement on October 20, 2017, an ETB 216,925,077 disbursement on April 4, 2018, an ETB 443,315,855 disbursement on April 4, 2018, an ETB 398,505,561 disbursement on April 4, 2018, an ETB 198,158,894 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 88,128,548 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 384,778,609 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 114,884,096 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 755,478,704 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 424,036,093 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 141,070,367 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 186,832,817 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 198,158,894 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 114,884,096 disbursement on October 26, 2018, an ETB 399,053,780 disbursement on November 1, 2018, an ETB 98,778,655 disbursement on November 1, 2018, an ETB 255,406,833 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 207,818,195 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 120,484,148 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 498,639,680 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 199,168,958 disbursement on August 23, 2019, an ETB 125,539,899 disbursement on December 24, 2019, an ETB 69,558,427 disbursement on December 24, 2019, an ETB 131,099,561 disbursement on December 24, 2019, an ETB 12,440,636 disbursement on October 22, 2010, and an ETB 15,657,678 disbursement on October 22, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to construct a sugar mill, construct a 135.5 meter-high and 840 meter-wide \\u2018May-Day\\u2019 irrigation dam on the Zarema River (next to the Waldiba Monastery) with the capacity to hold 3.5 billion cubic meters of water, install irrigation equipment, and construct a 4x30MW biogas power station (cogeneration power plant). About 70% of the electricity generated from the biogas power station (also known as the bagasse-fired power plant) will be used to run the sugar mill and 30% will connect to the surrounding area through a 137 kV electricity transmission line. The sugar mill (plant) will use sugarcane planted on 40,000 hectares of land and get irrigation water from the Tekeze, Kalema and Zarema rivers. Once it is fully operational, the sugar mill is expected to crush 24,000 tons of sugarcane per day (tcd), produce 484,000 tons of sugar per year, and produce 41.654 million liters of ethanol per year. The project site is located in Tigray Regional State\\u2019s Western Zone in Welkayit District.   CAMCE is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Sur Construction is a subcontractor responsible for undertaking the construction of the irrigation dam. The project is being implemented in two phases (stages) and financed via two different loan tranches. On April 10, 2014, CAMCE signed a project design contract. Then, on October 9, 2016, a project commencement ceremony took place. Then, on March 15, 2019, Abraham Tekster, the Deputy Governor of Tigray, conducted an on-site project inspection. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 36 months (October 9, 2019). However, as of December 17, 2019, the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP noted that the \\u2018[irrigation] dam [was] not completed\\u2019 and the \\u2018field for sugar cane [was] not fully ready [for] production\\u2019. As of April 2020, the project had only achieved a 95% completion rate. On November 4, 2020, the Welkait Sugar Mill was damaged in an air raid during the Tigray conflict. The Chinese government ended up evacuating more than 600 of its citizens, including 187 employees from the Welkait Sugar Mill.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Welkait Sugar Mill Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. in 2019, Ethiopia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance announced that it was seeking to privatize the Welkait Sugar Mill (as part of a broader effort to address the government\\u2019s debt sustainability problems and the ESC\\u2019s inability to fund the ongoing operations of multiple, faltering sugar factories). Also, according to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On May 22, 2013, China Eximbank and Djibouti's Ministry of Finance signed a $491,793,000 (FDJ 87,146,000,000) buyer's credit loan agreement [ID# BLADJI2013001] for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project. This borrowing terms of the loan, which is captured via Project ID#46183, were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. The borrower also purchased buyer\\u2019s credit insurance from China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation, which is widely known as Sinosure. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $578,580,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the Government of Djibouti\\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Finance in Charge of Industry and Planning and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on January 30, 2012 and amended on November 7, 2012. The Government of Djibouti agreed to cover the remainder of the commercial contract cost ($58 million). According to Djibouti\\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the PBC (loan) had achieved a 32.2% disbursement rate ($114,115,453 out of $491,793,000) as of 2014 and it ultimately achieved a 84.6% disbursement rate (FDJ 73,753,000,000 out of FDJ 87,146,000,000).    The purpose of the project was to construct a 100 km segment from Ali Sabieh to Nagad of the 756 km Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to Doraleh port in Djibouti. CREC and CCECC were the contractors responsible for project implementation. Their EPC contract went into effect on April 12, 2012 and its originally scheduled completion date was April 12, 2017. Construction began on December 31, 2014 (when CCECC laid the first track down in Galile) and the railway was opened for use on January 1, 2018.   This project face several implementation problems. In 2015, President Guelleh pushed for the project to be completed before he stood for re-election in April 2016. Substantially reducing the project\\u2019s completion time pressured CCECC to accelerate their work. To address this challenge, CCECC reportedly used its own financing for the project\\u2019s initial stages until they received loan disbursements from China Eximban. CCECC also stopped work on the project for at least 2 weeks, and the Djiboutian authorities blamed CCECC manager Ding Zhaojun for the delay, claiming that he hadn\\u2019t settled all the required purchases on the Nagad to Doraleh portion. The Djiboutian authorities also complained about CCECC\\u2019s poor mismanagement, leading to $24 million in cost overruns because CCECC had not taken electrifying the railway into account. The Djiboutian government also claimed that CCECC used poor quality infrastructure materials and failed to comply with railway regulations. China International Engineering Consulting Corporation was later upon examine the quality of CCECC\\u2019s work.   On July 28, 2016, CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management agreement with a consortium of other Chinese companies. This consortium agreed to manage the railway for 5 years and provide training to Djiboutian workers who would assume management responsibility after the end of the 5-year term. It remains to be seen if the Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway will find a path to commercial viability. Sinosure reportedly had to step in and write off approximately $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the railway. According to a 2021 report published by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), \\u2018[t]he railway is electrified along its entire route, to save on fuel, as this would need to be imported [\\u2026] The decision [to electrify the railway] has, however, presented additional challenges. Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country\\u2019s dams, exacerbated by climate change. The construction of power transmission lines and lack of energy delayed the start of operations, even after construction was complete [\\u2026]. The line has been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. Chinese stakeholders, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad.  Interviews also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the [Ethiopian Railways Corporation] has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. The plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals; it is not clear whether this has been properly assessed. Profitability is another issue. Initially, the price of a passenger ticket was set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to ETB, meaning that the project will generate less revenue than originally planned. This would not be a problem given that the project was planned to be catalytic, i.e. it was supposed to promote further economic activity, rather than being financially viable on its own. However, the railway does not seem to be playing this catalytic role since its last mile issues (it does not connect directly to the port in Djibouti or to industrial parks in Ethiopia) do not make the train a suitable mode of transport for business purposes. Our interviews revealed that last mile links were not [prioritized] during the construction of the new line, but are now being built. The last mile sections are managed by Ethiopian Shipping, a large parastatal. Ethiopian Shipping does not seem to be fully cooperating with the [Ethiopian Railways Corporation].\\u2019    There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer's credit loan for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On December 31, 2017, the Government of Djibouti formally requested a restructuring of its loan with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project. According to an email correspondence between the Executive Director of AidData and an IMF Mission Chief to Djibouti, in 2019, the Djiboutian authorities conducted discussions with China Eximbank to restructure a 2013 loan for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project (captured via Project ID#46183). The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) had been signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and to reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country\\u2019s GDP) had been restructured\\u2014and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period. The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country\\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021. Then, in March 2020, International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that the stock of the Government of Djibouti's external arrears -- including arrears to China, Belgium, Spain, Iran, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and UAE -- stood at $107 million. Two months later, in May 2020, a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the World Bank and the IMF concluded that Djibouti was at a high risk of debt distress.  Then, in March 2022, the World Bank published a report (entitled \\u2018Djibouti Economic Monitor Winter 2021\\u2019), which noted that \\u2018[o]n the debt side, liquidity tensions are likely to arise due to the payment of deferred debt service linked to the DSSI, the maturing of the two [China Eximbank] loans on the water pipeline project connecting Djibouti to Ethiopia loan in 2022, and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway project in 2025.\\u2019 Then, on November 29, 2022, the South China Morning Post reported that the Government of Djibouti had suspended debt service payment to China Eximbank. Djibouti\\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry responded to the South China Morning Post report by releasing a public statement on December 7, 2022. The statement by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry noted that the Government of Djibouti had honored 85% of its loan repayment obligations in 2022. It also acknowledged that, as part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), China Eximbank agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2020 and 2021 under multiple loan agreements, and that the Government of Djibouti\\u2019s debt service obligations tripled with the expiration of DSSI. Then, in 2023, Djibouti\\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry published a report, which identified the Government of Djibouti\\u2019s total arrears to China as being equivalent to DJF 24,104,000,000 ($135,285,797) as of December 31, 2022. \",\"In 2017, the Henan Branch of China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $500 million agreement with AviaAM Financial Leasing China (AviaAM)  \\u2014 a joint venture between AviaAM Leasing (a Warsaw Stock Exchange-listed and Lithuania-headquartered aircraft leasing company) and Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Company (HNCA) \\u2014 to lease eight Airbus A320 aircraft to Russian airliner Aeroflot for a 12-year period. The legal adviser for the transaction was DLA Piper. The first three aircraft were all delivered on the same day with two delivered in Toulouse and one in Hamburg. All eight aircraft were delivered by September 21, 2017.  As a consequence of the February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western government issued a number of sanctions on the Russian aviation and airline industry. As a result, a number of leasing companies cancelled their lease agreements with Russian airliners. Despite the cancellations, Russia acted to seize the leased aircraft to maintain a fleet of air-worthy aircraft and prevent foreign currency outflows (since leasing contracts are denominated in United States dollars) in violation of the Cape Town Convention, an international treaty that stipulates the return of leased aircraft to their owners when contracts are cancelled. On March 14, 2022, after the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia passed a law to allow foreign-registered aircraft owned by non-Russian lessors to be placed on the Russian registry, making it likely that leasing companies would be unable to recover their assets. 10 Airbus A320-214 aircraft and three Airbus A321-211 owned by AviaAM Financial Leasing China \\u2014 possibly including the eight leased under the 2017 agreement to Aeroflot and/or the 16 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft leased under another 2017 agreement to Aeroflot (Project ID#67151) \\u2014 were re-registered in Russia, making it likely that ICBC Leasing would fail to recover its aircraft.\",\"On June 20, 2010, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) signed a $420,750,000 buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 14.5 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and a 3.067% interest rate. The Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower also purchased buyer\\u2019s credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $495 million commercial contract between EEPCo and Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC) for the electro-mechanical and hydraulic steel structure works component of the 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project, which was signed in May 2010.  According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), 15 loan disbursements (worth ETB 21,904,463,534) took place between 2012 and 2019: an ETB 1,102,591,696 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 1,256,266,119 disbursement on April 8, 2012, and an ETB 241,864,376 disbursement on October 10, 2012, an ETB 519,482,004 disbursement on April 8, 2013, an ETB 149,053,030 disbursement on October 7, 2013, an ETB 1,120,000,000 disbursement on October 7, 2014, an ETB 323,232,323 disbursement on January 7, 2015, an ETB 450,503,881 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 200,679,002 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 286,223,972 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 164,701,197 disbursement on July 7,, 2016, an ETB 1,359,428,420 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 116,911,052 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB 1,045,494,392 disbursement on March 20, 2018, and an ETB 13,568,032,070 disbursement on September 9, 2019.  The purpose of the project was to supply and install electrical and mechanical equipment (turbines) for the construction of the Gilgel Gibe III Dam (also known as the Gibe III Dam). The Gilgel Gibe III Dam is 610 m-long (2,000 ft) and 243 m (797 ft) high roller-compacted concrete dam. It withholds a reservoir with a capacity of 14.7 km3 (3.5 cu mi) and a surface area of 210 km2 (81 sq mi), collecting with a catchment area of 34,150 km2 (13,190 sq mi). The reservoir's live (active or \\u2018useful\\u2019) storage is 11.75 km3 (2.82 cu mi) and dead storage 2.95 km3 (0.71 cu mi). The normal operating level of the reservoir is 892 m (2,927 ft) above sea level with a maximum of 893 m (2,930 ft) and minimum of 800 m (2,600 ft). The dam's spillway is 108 m (354 ft) long and floodgate-controlled with a maximum discharge capacity of 18,000 m3/s (640,000 cu ft/s). Water above 873 m (2,864 ft) above sea level can be discharged through its gates. Feeding the dam's power house are two penstocks that each branch into five separate tunnels for each individual turbine. The power house contains ten 187 MW generators supported by Francis turbines for a total installed capacity of 1,870 MW.   DEC was responsible for the electro-mechanical and hydraulic steel structure works component of the project. Salini Costruttori S.p.A.(SPA), an Italian contractor, completed the civil engineering construction of the project.   The electro-mechanical portion of the project involved the design; build; site testing and commission of 10 vertical type hydraulic turbines; 10 vertical axis synchronous generators; and other transformer-related tasks. The hydro mechanical portion included the installation of steel structures; gates; a draft tube; a diversion tunnel; a spillway and ecological discharge gates.   The construction of the Gibe III dam began in July 2006 along the Omo River but the project provoked a backlash from environmental activists. The African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank were originally supposed to fund the electro-mechanical costs for the project, but they eventually backed out due to the project's perceived negative environmental and social impacts. In August 2015, Ethiopia commissioned the first phase of electricity generation at the Gibe III plant from three turbines with an output of 561MW. Then, on December 17, 2016, the Gibe III dam was officially inaugurated. The plant has 10 turbines each with a capacity of 187MW equaling a total capacity of 1,870MW, increasing Ethiopia's total electricity output to 4,238 megawatts. This project also reportedly created more than 7,000 jobs.  There are some indications that the ICBC loan for the 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country\\u2019 (see Project ID#58616). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On January 19, 2016, China Eximbank expressed its willingness to finance Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project. Then, on April 5, 2017, China Eximbank formally issued a $675.5 million \\u2018mixed credit\\u2019 to the Government of the Republic of Cameroon for Phase 2. It provided an RMB 1 billion government concessional loan (GCL) (captured via Project ID#53116) and a $524,579,992 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) loan (captured via Project ID#53396).   The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 7 year grace period. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 22 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 11 year grace period. Both loans were secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the revenues of the Autonomous Port of Kribi, which were to be deposited by the borrower into an escrow account (known as the \\u2018Control Account\\u2019).  The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development (MINEPAT).   As of December 31, 2020, the GCL had achieved a 21.1% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 64.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 17.3 billion. As of December 31, 2020, the PBC had achieved a 25.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 200.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 31.4 billion.   Phase 2 involved the construction of a 1,102m long quay, the expansion of the container terminal from 700m to 1,050m, and the addition of both an ore and oil terminal. China Harbour Engineering Company Limited was the contractor responsible for implementation. Phase 2 was completed on March 2, 2018.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon \\u2014 with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 \\u2014 by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) \\u2014 or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon\\u2019s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini \\u00e0 Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.\\u2019\",\"On January 21, 2013, China Eximbank and the Cameroonian Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development signed a buyer's credit loan (BCL) agreement (Contract No. BLACAM 2011001) worth $541,566,018 for Phase 1 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of the BCL are as follows: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.10% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a 0.50% management fee. The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Cameroon agreed to provide the lender with a repayment guarantee (as defined in Article 1 of the BCL agreement). The borrower also purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the total cost ($637,136,492) of a commercial (EPC) contract between Cameroon\\u2019s Ministry of Water and Energy and Sinohydro Corporation, which was signed on April 12, 2012.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and the its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 203.4 billion.   The Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project is a large-scale hydro-electric run-of-river dam and hydroelectric generator plant that involves a barrage that is 1,260 meters long and 14 meters high, with two overflow channels and a grand spillway to the generating plant. The dam site is around 26 square kilometers. The plant has four generators and turbines each. It is expected to inject 211 MW of electricity into Cameroon's energy supply network. The plant is located in Nyabizan on the Ntem River in the South region, 300 km from Yaounde. Sinohydro Corporation was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. On June 15, 2012, President Paul Biya presided over the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the project. Construction was completed in August 2016.   Project ID#57586 captures a separate China Eximbank loan worth $141.8 million loan for Phase 2 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The proceeds of this loan were used by the borrower for the construction of 294 pylons between Nyabizan and Ebolowa to evacuate 211MW of power from the Memve'ele dam to Yaounde, the installation of 225 KV transmission lines, and the construction and installation of three transformer substations with a capacity of 225/90 KV in the localities of Ebolowa, Nkoumou in the South Region and Ahala in the Centre Region. As of September 30, 2021, the construction of the Nyabizan-Yaound\\u00e9 evacuation line had achieved a 92% completion rate. However, the completion of Phase 2 depends on payment of compensation to the people affected by the transmission line\\u2019s corridor. According to the Government of Cameroon, the revenue generated by the power plant and Nyabizan-Yaound\\u00e9 transmission line since \\u2018powering up\\u2019 from April 2019 to October 2021 amounts to CFAF 45 billion. In addition, the partial completion of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project has reportedly enabled the shutdown of the Ahala, Oyom-Abang, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa thermal power stations.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

The borrowing terms included a 2.898% interest rate (LIBOR plus 230 basis points), a 5-year maturity, and no grace period. Interest would be payable semi-annually through maturity in June 2016. The principal of these loans is payable commencing in October 2014. In July 2011, CDB disbursed $380 million. As of December 31, 2012, the outstanding principal amount under this credit facility was $380 million.  This is not the first time CDB has lent to TMAR or its parent company Oi. In 2009, CDB provided a $300 million loan to Oi to purchase Huawei equipment (see Project ID#38142). In 2011, CDB provided a $500 million credit facility for debt repayment purposes (see Umbrella Project ID#59418). In 2015, CDB provided two separate $600 million loans to Oi: one for purchasing more Huawei equipment (see Project ID#59744) and another to help refinance TMAR's debts (see Project ID#59611).  In June 2016, Oi SA filed Brazil's largest ever bankruptcy. Consequently, they were not able to meet their repayment obligations to CDB. On June 29, 2016, the request for processing the Judicial Reorganization of Oi Group was granted by the Judicial Reorganization Court and the respective Judicial Reorganization Plan (\\\"PRJ\\\") was approved by Oi Group creditors at the Creditors\\u2019 General Meeting held on December 19 and 20, 2017 and ratified by the Judicial Reorganization Court by decision issued on January 8, 2018. This plan described the different conditions and measures to be adopted to reverse Oi Group\\u2019s momentary crisis, having demonstrated its economic-financial and operational feasibility, as well as the profitability of its activities.\",\"In June 2011, Bank of China and CNPC-AktobeMunaiGaz JSC (CNPC AMG) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of CNPC and AktobeMunaiGaz (a Kazakh state-owned oil company) that develops hydrocarbon deposits in the Aktobe region of western Kazakhstan \\u2014 signed a $500 million loan agreement for working capital purposes. The loan carried an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin and 5-year maturity (final maturity date: June 2016). However, the loan was eventually rescheduled and its final maturity date was extended to 2021. The loan rescheduling is captured via Project ID#96017. The borrower was responsible for making interest payments every 3 months. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, the loan\\u2019s (principal) outstanding amount was $420,000,000. By December 31, 2021, the loan had been repaid in full.\",\"On March 31, 2011, China Development Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $500 million loan facility agreement (No. 4500062212011110472) for the Rehabilitation and Improvement of Priority Road Project 2 (PRP2). This loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR pus a 2.9% margin, a 0.5% management fee, and a 3.26% Sinosure insurance (risk) premium. The loan was apparently secured by (i.e. collateralized against) cash deposits in an escrow account. The first tranche (worth $326 million) was received by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka on June 29, 2011 and second tranche (worth $174 million) was on October 28, 2011.   $157 million was disbursed in 2011 and 2012, $118.52 million was disbursed in 2013, $161.01 was disbursed in 2014, $51.37 was disbursed in 2016, and $7.38 million was disbursed in 2016. The loan had achieved an 99.5% disbursement rate ($497.56 million out of $500 million) as of December 31, 2016. $2,435,206.99 was disbursed in 2017, bringing the loan disbursement rate to 99.99% ($499,995,206.99). The borrower made repayments worth $38,460,000 in 2018, $38,460,000 in 2019, $38,460,000 in 2020 and $38,460,000 in 2021.

By early 2022, it was clear that the loan was non-performing. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Development Bank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement. By March 2023, the Government of Sri Lanka had accumulated $338 million in arrears to China Development Bank.  The total cost of the PRP2 was $556 million. 90% of the project cost was covered by CDB and approximately 10% of the project cost was provided by the Government of Sri Lanka.

Implementation PRP2 began on June 28, 2011 and it was completed on December 31, 2014.  \",\"On July 23, 2015, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation (ESC) \\u2014 an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise \\u2014 signed a $550 million (ETB 11,262,597,025) export buyer\\u2019s credit (loan) agreement for the Omo Kuraz 5 Project. The Government of Ethiopia issued a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: an 8-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.95% margin. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the total cost of a $647 million commercial contract between Jianglian Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. and the ESC, which was signed on August 13, 2013.   According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $550 million loan achieved an 88% disbursement rate, with ICBC making 9 loan disbursements (worth ETB 9,961,853,894) between 2016 and 2018: an ETB 2,448,261,038 disbursement on May 31, 2016, an ETB 298,977,218 disbursement on April 30, 2017, an ETB 692,625,989 disbursement on September 18, 2018, an ETB 75,043,474 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 27,682,313 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 34,611,272 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 778,810,201 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 280,385,250 disbursement on November 23, 2018, and an ETB 5,325,457,140 disbursement on November 23, 2018.   The Omo Kuraz Sugar Project consists of five sugar plants (Omo Kuraz 1, Omo Kuraz 2, Omo Kuraz 3, Omo Kuraz 4, and Omo Kuraz 5). The Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project involves the construction of the fifth factory in the Omo-Kuraz Sugar Project. This factory is located in Awi Zone\\u2019s Jawi District of Amhara region. Upon completion, the facility is expected to produce 242,000 tons of sugar and 20 million 827 liters ethanol a year at full capacity. As part of the project, extensive irrigation infrastructure is also being constructed on Omo River in order to enable 100,000 hectares of land to be covered with sugarcane.  Jiangxi Jianglian International Engineering Co. Ltd (JJIEC), a subsidiary of Jianglian Heavy Industry, is the contractor responsible for project implementation. According to the ESC, the project is being undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 construction activities commenced in November 2016. To date, 30,000 hectares of land at the project site have been irrigated, of which 16,0000 hectares are covered with sugarcane.   However, this project has also become a source of scandal and controversy. On July 25, 2017, Yuan Jialin, the JJIEC head of the Omo Kuraz 5 Project, was detained in relation to an alleged act of corruption: paying a $30 million bribe (\\u2018commission\\u2019) for Ethiopian Ministry of Finance officials to illegally grant a contract to JJIEC. Yuan Jialin, wrote a letter to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on May 29, 2018, requesting his personal intervention. In his letter, he indicated that he had been denied bail for nearly a year. He also wrote that \\u201cJJIEC [\\u2026] operates on the highest standard and uses fair and competitive system of procurement and carefully controls projects at hand to be free from corruptive and fraudulent activities.\\\" Jialin also argued in the letter that it was difficult to commit corruption in a strictly monitored purchase process. He claimed that there has not been any evidence to substantiate the charges brought against him. He also noted that, while JJIEC recruited a lawyer to investigate the alleged corruption, he was subjected to an inappropriate search which resulted in physical and psychological damages to him. He also asserted that the documentary evidence presented to substantiate the charges against him were counterfeit. He also warned that the \\u2018dire situation\\u2019 of the Omo Kuraz 5 project might hamper the bilateral relations between the Ethiopian Government and JJIEC, and requested that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed establish a neutral and separate body to see his case and give him a speedy trial.  There are indications that the ICBC loan for the Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements for the Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country.' Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023. \",\"On August 30, 2005, China Eximbank signed a $300 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka for the Phase I of Puttalam/Norochcholai Coal Power Project. The PBC (captured via Project ID#33244) carries a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and an interest rate of 2%. It had disbursed $142,821,238.39 as of December 31, 2007 (Rs. 15,792,886,899) and $168,963,610.51 as of December 31, 2008 (Rs. 18,303,490,000). The borrower made repayments worth $19,978,236.69 in 2014 (Rs. 2,608,894,000).

On September 8, 2006, China Eximbank signed a $152,982,428 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) with the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka for Phase I of the Puttalam/Norochcholai Coal Power Project. The BCL (captured via Project ID#33463) carries a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 6% interest rate.

The Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka then used the proceeds from the BCL and PBC to on-lend to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is a state-owned electricity company that controls all major functions of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing in Sri Lanka. This project involved the installation of a 300MW coal power plant, a jetty for coal handling, and transmission lines from Norochcholai to Veyangoda and substation at Veyangoda. China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. A project inauguration ceremony took place on May 11, 2006. Phase I construction began on July 23, 2007. The first 300-megawatt phase was completed and ceremonially commissioned by President Mahinda Rajapaksa on March 22, 2011.  However, there are indications that project has encountered debt repayment problems. In 2021, CEB disclosed that the Sri Lankan Treasury had \\u2018take[n] over [its] repayment obligation[s] due to non-availability of appropriate income based on the tariff approved by [Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka].\\u2019 Then, on April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.\",\"In 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project.

The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a $2.37 billion commercial contract between Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute, which was signed on April 28, 2009.   As of June 20, 2017, $1.513 billion had been disbursed by China Eximbank for the Chashma Nuclear Power Project 3 and Chashma Nuclear Power Project across all three loan agreements (PBC, GCL, and BCL).   The purpose of the project was to construct Unit 3 and Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant (or CHASNUPP), which is a large commercial nuclear power plant located in the vicinities of Chashma colony and Kundian in Punjab in Pakistan (exact locational coordinates are 32.390278, 71.4625). More specifically, the purpose of the project was to (a) construct CHASNUPP-III, a 315-MW two-loop pressurized water reactor (PWR), using between 2.4\\u20143.0% low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel with a gross capacity of 340 MW; and (b) construct CHASNUPP-IV, another 315-MW two-loop pressurized reactor with a gross capacity of 340 MW.    China Zhongyuan Engineering, China Nuclear Industry No.5 Construction Company, and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering and Research Design Institute were the contractors responsible for Unit 3 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. China National Nuclear Cooperation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) supervised the work of all four Chinese contractors.  Construction of CHASNUPP-III (also known as C3 or Unit 3) commenced on May 28, 2011. CHASNUPP-III joined the nation's electricity grid system on October 15, 2016 and commenced its operations on December 6, 2016. It was officially inaugurated on December 28, 2016. Construction of CHASNUPP-IV (also known as C4 or Unit 4) started on December 18, 2011. CHASNUPP-IV was connected to nation's grid system on June 25, 2017 and it commenced its operations on September 19, 2017.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer's credit loan for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-038]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the buyer's credit loan agreement for the Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, in April 2022, local media reported that the operation of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant and the repayment of the China Eximbank loans that supported its construction had become a challenge due the absence of requisite payments from the Government of Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency\\u2013Guaranteed (CPPA-G). The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2020-December 2020 is captured via Project ID#96254. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96250. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.\",\"On December 18, 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) signed two separate loan agreements with a total value of $1.2 billion with Telemar Norte Leste S.A. (TMAR), a Brazilian telecommunications company and subsidiary of Oi S.A. The first was a $600 million buyer's credit loan and the second was a $600 million refinancing credit agreement. Oi S.A. served as guarantor for both loans.  The purpose of the buyer's credit (captured via Project ID#59744) was to purchase equipment and services from Huawei Technologies. The original borrowing terms included a 9.5-year maturity (final maturity date: June 18, 2025), no grace period, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. Under the original buyer\\u2019s credit agreement, the principal amount was to be amortized with 14 semiannual installments taking place from April 2019 to June 2025. The purpose of the refinancing credit agreement (captured via Project ID#59611) was to help repay previous CDB loans. The original borrowing terms included a 5-year maturity (final maturity date: December 18, 2020), no grace period, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 190 basis points. Under the original refinancing credit agreement, the principal amount was to be amortized with 14 semiannual installments taking place from April 2019 to December 2020.  Then, in June 2016, Oi S.A. (\\u201cOi\\u201d) filed Brazil's largest ever bankruptcy. Consequently, the borrower was unable to meet its repayment obligations to CDB until 2023 at the earliest. After a nearly 2-year long process, creditors of Oi and several of its subsidiaries \\u2014 including Telemar Norte Leste S.A. (TMAR) \\u2014 approved a plan of reorganization at a creditors meeting on December 19, 2017, held in a former Olympic boxing venue on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, to restructure nearly $20 billion in claims, the largest corporate restructuring in the history of Latin America (and potentially any emerging market), and the first truly public Brazilian company to go through judicial restructuring since Brazil reformed its insolvency laws in 2005. After initially considering an attempted out-of-court exchange in the spring of 2016, Oi and several of its subsidiaries filed for judicial reorganization in Brazil in June 2016, and the Brazilian reorganization court accepted jurisdiction over each of the debtors, including Oi\\u2019s two Dutch finance subsidiaries, Oi Brasil Holdings Co\\u00f6peratief U.A. (\\u201cCoop\\u201d) and Portugal Telecom International Finance B.V. (\\u201cPTIF\\u201d). Shortly thereafter, Oi and/ or certain other of the debtors in Brazil filed for additional protection in ancillary proceedings in New York and the United Kingdom, as well as separate proceedings in the Netherlands. In Brazil, as in most countries, the bankruptcy law respects the corporate separateness of debtors, and therefore it is the general rule that, within a corporate group restructuring, creditors\\u2019 claims will not be treated pari passu with those of creditors of other members of the corporate group. However, particularly since the Rede Energia S.A. restructuring in 2014, Brazilian courts have increasingly confirmed restructuring plans for Brazilian corporate groups that substantively consolidate creditor claims, even over the objections of creditors. Oi\\u2019s initial proposed restructuring plan, presented in September 2016, took a substantively consolidated approach. Various creditor groups opposed such substantive consolidation (albeit for different reasons), and filed motions against substantive consolidation with the restructuring court. An appeals court in Rio de Janeiro ultimately decided that the question of substantive consolidation was one that should be determined by creditors by vote at a creditors meeting. Importantly, the judge ruled that this vote should occur on an entity-by-entity basis, thereby providing the creditors of Oi and its debtor-subsidiaries with an important protection by ultimately leaving the decision on whether to accept substantive consolidation in the hands of creditors \\u2013 if creditors at any particular entity were to reject substantive consolidation, it would present significant difficulties for the rest of the Oi Group to restructure on a substantively consolidated basis. If this decision is adopted more widely as precedent in Brazil, it could represent an important step in the right direction towards protecting creditors\\u2019 interest against unfettered substantive consolidation. In Oi\\u2019s case, a consensual deal with creditors was eventually reached, and creditors of each debtor entity voted in favor of substantive consolidation. Oi\\u2019s restructuring plan was approved, on a substantively consolidated basis, on December 19, 2017, after a nearly two-year process. The plan was confirmed by the Brazilian restructuring court in January 2018. Then, on June 21, 2018, Telemar Norte Leste S.A. and CDB reached an agreement to restructure $671,479,642.10 of outstanding debt under a revised set of repayment terms, including an additional 66-month grace period, a fixed interest rate of 1.75%, and a revised repayment schedule (with non-linear amortization) beginning on August 25, 2023 and ending February 25, 2035 (as captured via Project ID#96429). \",\"On May 22, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $448 million buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID# CN-BCL-2013-01 and 2012211330] for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#35266). The borrowing terms of the 2013 BCL were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 8 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin, a 0.75% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. Then, on September 29, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a second BCL agreement [ID# 2016211190] worth $576 million for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#54087). The borrowing terms of the 2016 BCL were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 8 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin, a 0.75% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. Both BCLs were to be repaid and secured with cash (from surcharges on electricity) deposited in an escrow account known as the Neelum-Jhelum Hydro Power Development Fund. As of December 28, 2018, the cash balance of the escrow account was approximately $10,760,508 (PKR 1.49 billion).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent the proceeds of the BCLs (at a 12% interest rate) to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC), which is a project company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) that was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project. As of June 30 2017, the $576 million BCL had fully disbursed and the $448 million BCL had achieved a 42.6% disbursement rate ($191.067 million out of $448 million).  According to a March 2018 tariff petition that NJHPC submitted to Pakistan\\u2019s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of 506,579 million Pakistani rupees (PKR) was to be financed according to a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total amount of debt financing amounted to PKR 401,416 million, which is roughly equivalent to $3.823 billion. Additional foreign sources of debt financing included $358 million from the Islamic Development Bank, $181 million from the Saudi Fund for Development, $81 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development, and $74 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development.  The 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project is a run-of-the-river project in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The power plant has four power generation units and it was designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri, 41 km northeast of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse was constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 km south of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 km south of ChatterKalas. Upon completion, the project was expected to produce 5.15 billion units of electricity annually.  The EPC contractor for this project was a Chinese consortium known as CGGC-CMEC that consisted of China Gezhouba Group Co., Ltd. (CGGC) and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMEC). In January 2008, a letter of commencement was issued to the EPC contractor. The implementation of the project began on February 9, 2008 and construction activities were originally expected to reach completion by October 2016. According to WAPDA, 90% of the construction works were completed by March 2018. The project was officially completed on April 13, 2018. The Neelum-Jhelum power plant delivered 590 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from unit three on July 4, 2018, 453 GWh from unit four on October 4, 2018, 331 GWh from unit two on August 27, 2018 and 314 GWh from unit one on December 28, 2018. The project was originally expected to achieve its commercial operations date (COD) by December 2018. However, it is unclear if the project achieved this goal. As of February 2021, Pakistan\\u2019s Ministry of Water Resources had still not officially communicated the final COD to the Power Division. By April 11, 2019, the project had injected 2,400 GWh of energy into the national grid.  This project was plagued by controversy. In a performance audit of the project that Pakistan\\u2019s Auditor General (AG) submitted to the parliament in February 2019, the AG concluded that \\u2018NJHP is an exemplary mismanaged project resulting into heavy cost and time overrun.\\u2019 The audit reported an \\u2018unjustified abnormal cost overrun of [PKR 389 billion]\\u2019 and losses due to non-achievement of envisaged financial benefits of PKR 237 billion. It also reported losses of PKR 30 billion of revenue and an unjustified claim of PKR 175 million rock burst and an unjustified and uneconomical deployment of tunnel boring machine that failed to achieve envisaged benefits of PKR 23.15 billion. The audit also pointed to the irregular and unjustified award of construction of contract of PKR 90.90 billion before the appointment of consultants and non-obtaining of performance guarantees worth PKR 48.8 billion resulting into suspension of foreign loans and delay in the project. Also, the AG highlighted poor performance of consultants for the project engaged at the cost of PKR 16 billion and non-recovery of PKR 9.90 billion as liquidity damages from the contractors. Other problems identified by the audit include non-achievement of financial close till the project completion, delays in land acquisition, delays in adequate power supply, frequent major design changes, non-finalization of detailed engineering design, and frequent issuance of variation orders. Transparency International Pakistan also alleged that the procurement of tunnel-boring machines (TBM), which were meant to speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels, resulted in $74 million in kickbacks.   On July 4, 2022, when the power plant was running at its full capacity (969MW), an abnormal increase in water leakage was observed which was controlled through continuous drainage pumps and an investigation into the excessive leakage was started. On July 5, 2022, an emergency meeting was held between the project management and the project consultants team to analyze the situation and determine the root cause of excessive water leakage. It was observed that tailrace tunnel had obtained an abnormal pressure of 616m instead of the normal 600m. It was also pointed out by the project consultants that abnormal pressure of 616m in the TRT (tailrace tunnel) had been recorded which otherwise remained below 600 meter. Accordingly, to ascertain behaviour of TRT, one unit was shut down which resulted in decrease in pressure to 608m. The consultants recommended that TRT pressure should be below 604m. In this way, load was reduced gradually. Then, on July 6, 2022, it was determined that the abnormal increase in pressure and water leakages/seepage was due to blockage in TRT and considering the safety of the structure and all other equipment, the power house was shut down. Soon afterwards and after necessary preparation (lowering of bulkhead gates by Mobile Crane, functional check of dewatering pumps etc.), dewatering was started on July 10, 2022. After completion of dewatering up to the main collapse point (293m), an inspection of the tunnel was carried out. According to the findings of a report, 'It was found that tunnel is fully blocked in 42m portion (between 251m and 293m) besides other damages.' Upon submission of the report to the Prime Minister's Office, a meeting was held on July 13., 2022 in which the Prime Minister instructed the government to engage a foreign consulting firm for determine the causes of the defect and seek advice on the remedial works. A detailed ToR for consulting firms was issued by the Prime Minister's Office, which was later finalized by the inter-ministerial committee at a meeting held on July 26, 2022. Immediately after the incident, CGGC was engaged for carrying out repairs. The contractor started mobilization at the site and subsequently a contract agreement was signed with the firm on August 25, 2022. Work on the restoration of plant commenced shortly thereafter. However, in September 2022, Chinese engineers and staff reportedly abandoned the repair of the 969 MW Neelum-Jhelum hydropower facility, which faced issues related to substantial cracks in a tunnel, resulting in a shutdown of the power plant coinciding with a power crisis in the country.  The Chinese workers were reportedly facing security issues with local residents. The Government of Pakistan, at the time, rejected claims that work has stopped at the project site.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer\\u2019s credit loan for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In November 2019, NJHPC CEO Mohammad Zareen testified before Pakistan's National Assembly Standing Committee on Planning and Development and noted that '[i]f revenue from the Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) does not commence by December 2019, the NJHPC/Wapda/GoP shall go into default due to back-to-back guarantee, apart from the NJHPC not meeting the routine maintenance expense.' Mohammad Zareen also testified that CGGC-CMEC abandoned the project after it had achieved a 99.6% completion rate and after shelling by the Indian Army at the dam site in July 2019 and October 2019. He said the Chinese contractor was not willing to return. Mohammad  Zareen said the company\\u2019s annual debt service liability amounted to Rs 50 billion and it was getting regular letters from the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) every month for the servicing of debt to external lenders. 'I will not have the funds to pay even for salaries after December [2019]', he said, adding that the Rs 100 billion raised from local banks was currently being utilized for debt servicing and salaries.  He also noted that Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) CPPA had not signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with NJHPC: 'The PPA between the CPPA-G and the NJHPC, drafted and cleared by the legal section of the CPPA in June 2019, was submitted to the CPPA in July 2019 for approval of invoicing of payment of energy delivered, but is not being approved.' Consequently, NJHPC was not paid for energy delivered through the end of 2019. The non-signing of the PPA between the CPPA and NJHPC resulted in a circular debt build-up of about Rs 75 billion. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-036]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project.

The face value of the GCL was subsequently downsized to $554,251,553.96. The BCL carried the following terms: an interest rate of 6.35%, a grace period of 4 years, and a maturity of 15 years. It is backed by a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL to finance approximately 85% of a $670 million commercial contract between Corporaci\\u00f3n El\\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador (CELEC E.P.) -- a state-owned holding company in Ecuador engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, commercialization, import and export of electric power -- and China Gezhouba Group Corporation.   The borrower made principal repayments worth $27,712,577 on March 21, 2017, $27,712,577 on September 21, 2017, $27,712,577 on March 21, 2018, $27,712,577 on September 21, 2018, $27,712,577 on March 21, 2019, $27,712,577 on September 21, 2019, $27,712,577 on March 21, 2020, and $36,026,351.50 on March 21, 2022. It did not make any principal repayments on the originally scheduled repayment dates of September 21, 2020, March 21, 2021, September 21, 2021, and September 21, 2022.

The Sopladora hydroelectric power plant is located along the Paute River in Azuay. It is part of the Hydropaute cascade scheme in the Paute River in the south-east of the country. China Gezhouba Group Corporation was the contractor responsible for project implementation. CELEC E.P. was also involved in project implementation. Construction began on April 26, 2011 and the power generation completion ceremony took place on August 25, 2016.   However, the China Eximbank loan (BCL) that supported this project has underperformed. It was rescheduled twice \\u2014 once in September 2020 (as captured via Project ID#93432) and again in September 2022 (as captured via Project ID#96294).\",\"Engro Powergen Thar Limited (EPTL) was a joint venture company \\u2014 established by Engro Powergen China Machinery and Engineering Company (CMEC), Habib Bank Limited (HBL), and Liberty Mills Limited \\u2014 that is responsible for establishing a 2 X 330 (660MW) mine mouth circulating fluidized bed technology coal-based power plant. The independent power plant project (IPP) was located at Thar Block II, 25 kilometers from the city of Islamkot, near the village of Singharo-Bitra in the district of Tharparkar within Sindh Province. Thar Block II was a 95.5 square kilometer area of the Thar coalfield, which has total lignite reserves of 175 billion tons which can be utilized to produce 100,000 MW for over 200 years. The project will be fueled by coal supplied by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), which was developing a coal mine of 3.8 million tonnes per annum capacity beside the project (see Project ID#54315).   The total estimated cost of the 2 X 330 MW Engro Thar Block II Coal Power Project was $1.1 billion USD which was financed with 75% debt and 25% equity. Accordingly, the total equity requirement is $275 million. The majority of the equity investment for the project was expected to be from EPTL and its affiliates. IJGlobal reported that China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) invested $96.95 million USD (see Project ID#54316). In December 2014, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's (ICBC) Karachi Branch submitted an initial expression of interest to provide $825 million USD of debt financing for the power project. Then, a set of financing agreements were signed in Beijing on December 21, 2015 for both the power plant aspect (this project) and the mining aspect (see Project ID#54315). Under these agreements with EPTL, the 2 X 330 MW Engro Thar Block II Coal Power Project project was supported by a Pakistani rupee-denominated syndicated facility agreement from consortium of banks including: HBL, United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, Askari Bank Limited, Soneri Bank Limited, Sindh Bank Limited, Bank of Punjab, MCB Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited, Pak Oman Investment Company Limited, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), National Bank of Pakistan, and Pak Brunei Investment Company Limited. The total syndicated loan is worth 17,016,000,000 Pakistan rupees.   Moreover, EPTL signed a bilateral facility agreement with National Bank of Pakistan worth 3,134,000,000 Pakistani rupees as well as Islamic facility agreements with three banks \\u2014 Meezan Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited and Habib Bank Limited \\u2014 worth 4,000,000,000 Pakistani rupees. All of these loans were repayable in 20 semi-annual installments commencing from the earlier of (i) first fixed date falling after 48 months since facility effective date and (ii) second fixed date falling after Commercial Operations Date (COD); where fixed dates are defined as first June or first December of any year and carries interest at the rate of 3 months KIBOR plus 3.5%.   On December 21, 2015, EPTL also signed a $621 million syndicated loan facility agreement with China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The borrowing terms of the syndicated loan facility are as follows: a 14-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin, and a 7% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan also provided a sovereign guarantee. As of December 31, 2018, EPTL drew down $504,731 against this facility. China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. In April 2016, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on July 10, 2019.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to EPTL. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 45 billion (approximately $225 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without \\u2018early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017\\u2019. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called \\u2018discos\\u2019). However, \\u2018due to various technical and financial constraints\\u2019, the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan\\u2019s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open \\u2018an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved\\u2019. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance\\u2019s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs\\u2019. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country\\u2019s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in May 2023, EPTL informed the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) that it might shut down operations entirely because of a 'severe liquidity crunch' that made it challenging for EPTL to settle its liabilities with both lenders and suppliers. Its outstanding receivables from the CPPA amounted to PKR 65.5 billion at the time. EPTL demanded the CPPA pay it PKR 28.7 billion before May 31, 2023 to help it avert a default on debt servicing.\",\"On September 17, 2012, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed three loan agreements for Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP): a $51 million China Eximbank buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL), a $600 million China Eximbank preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2012(42)Total No (230)], and an RMB 1 billion China Eximbank government concessional loan (GCL) [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL 2012(22) Total No 424]. However, the face value of the GCL was eventually reduced to RMB 700,365,503. The BCL is captured via Project ID#39025. The PBC is captured via Project ID#39023. The GCL is captured via Project ID#39024.  The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of BCL, PBC, and GCL to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. It was originally envisaged that SLPA would use the proceeds of the BCL, PBC, and GCL to finance 100% of the cost of a $808.1 million commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) on December 31, 2010.  The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4% margin, a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, a 0.7% commitment fee, and a 0.9% management fee. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee.  The GCL disbursed RMB 381,500,000 between 2012 and 2016, unknown amounts between 2017 and 2018, and RMB 318,793,357.83 in 2019. The GCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was RMB 673,428,368 as of June 30, 2022.  The PBC disbursed an unknown amount in 2012, an unknown amount in 2013, $147,249,692.27 in 2014, and $21,049,128.50 in 2015. As of December 31, 2019, it had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($600 million out of $600 million). The PBC\\u2019s amount outstanding was $600,000,000 as of December 31, 2016 and $484,615,385 as of June 30, 2022. The BCL was cancelled in 2019 and never disbursed.  Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area.  Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. CHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for HPDP Phase II implementation. Phase II was formally launched on November 18, 2010.  However, construction did not begin until September 16, 2012, a day before the three loan agreements were signed. Phase II was originally slated for completion in November 2015. A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. However, as of December 31, 2017, Phase II had still only achieved a 96% physical completion rate.  Phases I and II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) encountered financial management problems, debt repayment challenges, and corruption allegations. Hambantota Port generated lower-than-expected container traffic and proved to be commercially nonviable under SLPA ownership. Consequently, SLPA could not service its loans to China Eximbank. In response, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) \\u2014 a subsidiary of China Merchants Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) \\u2014 purchased a majority ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years.  More specifically, on July 29, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, and Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) signed a 99-year concession agreement and formed a joint venture to operate Hambantota Port. According to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CMPort acquired an 85% stake in Hambantota International Ports Group (HIPG) and a 49.3% stake in Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), representing about 70% of the total equity. CMPort was also granted the operating and management rights of HIPG and HIPS as well as the lease and development rights of approximately 11.5 square kilometers of land in the Hambantota port area. CMPort agreed to make a total equity investment of $1.12 billion, of which $974 million would be used to acquire the 85% stake in HIPG and $146 million would be deposited into a bank account in the name of CMPort in Sri Lanka (for the expansion of Hambantota Port and shipping-related business).  According to a July 20, 2017 Cabinet Memorandum entitled \\u2018Hambantota Port Concession Agreement\\u2019 (No. MPS/SEC/2017/32) that was approved by Sri Lanka\\u2019s Cabinet on August 4, 2017, when the concession agreement was signed, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans that were contracted for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred from SLPA to the General Treasury. Given that the General Treasury was also identified as the recipient of the $974 million cash infusion from CMPort, many media outlets and commentators reported that the arrangement represented a \\u2018debt-for-equity\\u2019 swap.  However, the Government of Sri Lanka continued to have difficulty servicing its debts to China Eximbank for Phases I and II of the HPDP after 2017. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. This decision to suspend external debt service affected all of the China Eximbank loans that were issued for Phases I and II of the HPDP.  Another source of controversy arose in June 2018 when the New York Times reported that $7.6 million had been transferred from a Standard Chartered Bank account controlled by China Harbor Engineering Co. (labelled \\u2018HPDP Phase 2\\u2019) to affiliates of President Rajapaksa\\u2019s re-election campaign. The New York Times also reported that checks worth $1.2 million (linked to the \\u2018HPDP Phase 2\\u2019 bank account) were delivered to President Rajapaksa\\u2019s official residence.\",\"The purpose of the Extension of Southern Expressway Project (ESEP) was to enhance the efficiency of the transport system by linking the country's major economic centers with Colombo City and other parts of the country. It was also designed to facilitate the activities of the Hambantota International Development Hub Project. It involves a 96 km extension of the Southern Expressway from Matara to Hambantota, and it consists of 4 sections.  ESEP Section 1 consists of the construction of a 30 km length road section from Matara to Beliatta. ESEP Section 2 consists of the construction of a 26 km length road section from Beliatta to Wetiya. The scope of this project includes the construction of 2 interchanges, 26 underpasses, 7 overpasses, 8 bridges, and 70 box culverts. ESEP Section 3 consists of the construction of a 15 km length road section from Wetiya to Andarawewa. The scope of this project includes the construction of 1 viaduct, 18 underpasses, 5 overpasses, 2 bridges, 45 box culverts, and 6 pipe culverts. This project also includes the construction of the Ranna-Wetiya Road (HR 21) and Sooriyawewa-Galwewa Junction-Embilipitiya Road (HR 06, HR 10). ESEP Section 4 consists of the construction of a 25 km length road section from Mattala to Hambantota via Andarawewa. The scope of this project includes the construction of 2 viaducts, 1 interchange, 6 bridges, 2 bridge underpasses, 2 overpasses, 10 culvert underpasses, 61 box culverts, and 1 aqueduct.   China Eximbank financed each of these sections of ESEP with four different loans. On December 23, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $683.5 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [PBC No. (2014) 27 Total No. (321)] for Section 1 (Matara to Beliatta) of ESEP. The face value of the PBC was subsequently downsized to $663,982,749. It carries the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, a 5-year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The borrower was expected to use to the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a SLR 103,280,000,000 commercial contract [ID# RDA/SEEP/CONT/S1] between China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Engineering (CATIC Engineering) and Sri Lanka's Road Development Authority (RDA), which was signed on October 31, 2013. The PBC (loan) disbursed $67,118,384.68 in 2015, $96,874,812.09 in 2016, $136,330,765 in 2017, $119,488,461 in 2018, $56,896,204 in 2019, $187,274,123 in 2020, and $44,265,516 in 2021. The PBC had achieved a 106.6% disbursement rate ($708,248,265.77 out of $663,982,749) as of December 31, 2021. The borrower made no repayments on the PBC from 2014 to 2020. The borrower made repayments on the PBC worth $44,265,516 in 2021. Its amount outstanding was $300,323,962 as of December 31, 2017, $419,812,423 as of December 31, 2018, $476,708,627 as of December 31, 2019, $663,982,750 as of December 31, 2020, $619,717,234 as of December 31, 2021, and $597,584,475 as of June 30, 2022.   Then, on April 7, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $360.3 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [PBC No. (2015) 38 Total No. (381)] for Section 2 (Beliatta to Wetiya) of ESEP. The face value of the PBC was subsequently downsized to $279,355,795. It carries the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, and a 5-year grace period. It disbursed $48,835,435.09 in 2016, $62,216,789 in 2017, $24,324,148 in 2018, $43,265,643 in 2019, $64,733,078 in 2020, and $35,980,703 in 2021.

Project ID#38337 captures the PBC for Section 1. Project ID#53526 captures the PBC for Section 2. Project ID#33488 captures the GCL for Section 3. Project ID#53522 captures the GCL for Section 4.   Section 1 was implemented by four Chinese firms \\u2014 AVIC International Engineering Corporation (a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corporation of China), China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC or 'China State Construction\\u2019), China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC), and China Railway First Survey and Design Institute Group. It commenced on January 16, 2016 and it was completed on January 19, 2019.   Section 2, which was implemented by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), commenced on October 28, 2016. Its target completion date was October 27, 2019, and as of December 31, 2018, it was 61.23% complete. It was completed on February 23, 2020.   Section 3, which was implemented by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), commenced on January 25, 2016, and as of December 31, 2018, it was 88.77% complete. Its original target completion date was January 24, 2018, but this section ran behind schedule due to soil issues and delays in possession of the site. It was completed on February 23, 2020.   Section 4, which was implemented by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC), commenced on January 19, 2016. Its target completion date is May 28, 2019, and as of December 31, 2018, it was 86.06% complete. Sections 1-4 were complete, and the Southern Expressway opened to traffic on February 23, 2020. The completion of the ESEP project has successfully linked Hambantota Port and Mattala Rajapaksa Hambantota Airport.   However, this project has also encountered debt repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement. \",\"In 2017, China Development Bank (Henan Branch) signed a $650 million agreement with AviaAM Financial Leasing China (AviaAM)  \\u2014 a joint venture between AviaAM Leasing (a Warsaw Stock Exchange listed and Lithuania-headquartered aircraft leasing company) and Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Company (HNCA) \\u2014 to lease 16 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft to Aeroflot Russian Airlines. The legal adviser for the transaction was LP and King Wood Mallesons. Deliveries of the aircraft were scheduled to begin in March 2017. Four Airbus A320s were delivered in the first half of 2017, and one Airbus 321 was delivered on July 7, 2017. A sixth Airbus was delivered on August 15, 2017.  As a consequence of the February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western government issued a number of sanctions on the Russian aviation and airline industry. As a result, a number of leasing companies cancelled their lease agreements with Russian airliners. Despite the cancellations, Russia acted to seize the leased aircraft to maintain a fleet of air-worthy aircraft and prevent foreign currency outflows (since leasing contracts are denominated in United States dollars) in violation of the Cape Town Convention, an international treaty that stipulates the return of leased aircraft to their owners when contracts are cancelled. On March 14, 2022, after the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia passed a law to allow foreign-registered aircraft owned by non-Russian lessors to be placed on the Russian registry, making it likely that leasing companies would be unable to recover their assets. 10 Airbus A320-214 aircraft and three Airbus A321-211 owned by AviaAM Financial Leasing China \\u2014 possibly including the 16 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft leased under the 2017 agreement to Aeroflot and/or the eight leased under another 2017 agreement to Aeroflot (Project ID#67101) \\u2014 were re-registered in Russia, making it likely that ICBC Leasing would fail to recover its aircraft.\",\"On April 11, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and China Eximbank signed a syndicated facility (loan) agreement with OAO Yamal LNG (or JSC Yamal LNG or \\u041e\\u0410\\u041e \\\"\\u042f\\u043c\\u0430\\u043b \\u0421\\u041f\\u0413\\\") \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Russia\\u2019s OAO NOVATEK (50.1% ownership stake), France's Total S.A.

The facility agreement was amended on April 29, 2016. The financing from CDB and China Eximbank is part of the project finance package totaling the equivalent of $18.4 billion.  The total cost of the project is approximately $36 billion and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. The project reached financial close with CDB and China Eximbank in June 2016.   CDB issued both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67064) was worth EUR 5,057,800,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67063) was worth RMB 5,286,000,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%.   China Eximbank provided both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67062) was worth EUR 4,279,700,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67041) was worth RMB 4,472,500,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%.   In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069).   The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant \\u2014 with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field \\u2014 located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek \\u2014 Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer \\u2014 to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia\\u2019s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called \\u201cNational Wealth Fund\\u201d). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019\\u20132021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (\\u5927\\u9023\\u4e2d\\u9060\\u6d77\\u904b\\u6cb9\\u54c1\\u904b\\u8f38\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: \\u00ab\\u042d\\u0434\\u0443\\u0430\\u0440\\u0434 \\u0422\\u043e\\u043b\\u043b\\u044c\\u00bb), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0420\\u0443\\u0434\\u043e\\u043b\\u044c\\u0444 \\u0421\\u0430\\u043c\\u043e\\u0439\\u043b\\u043e\\u0432\\u0438\\u0447\\u00bb), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: \\u00ab\\u041d\\u0438\\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u0430\\u0439 \\u0415\\u0432\\u0433\\u0435\\u043d\\u043e\\u0432\\u00bb), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0412\\u043b\\u0430\\u0434\\u0438\\u043c\\u0438\\u0440 \\u0412\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u043d\\u0438\\u043d\\u00bb) all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0413\\u0435\\u043e\\u0440\\u0433\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0423\\u0448\\u0430\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432\\u00bb) which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: \\u00ab\\u042f\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432 \\u0413\\u0430\\u043a\\u043a\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u00bb) which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (\\u682a\\u5f0f\\u4f1a\\u793e\\u5546\\u8239\\u4e09\\u4e95). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsv\\u00e5g, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from \\u2018unfriendly states\\u2019\\u2014including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine\\u2014in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia\\u2019s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia\\u2019s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany\\u2019s Euler Hermes, Sweden\\u2019s EKN, Austria\\u2019s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China\\u2019s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia\\u2019s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'\",\"On July 18, 2012, the Government of Mozambique ratified a $681,590,562.91 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement with China Eximbank for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project. (as captured via Project ID#1240). The BCL, which was finalized after the Government of Portugal failed to fulfill its 2010 commitment to finance the bridge, carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 4%.   The Government of Mozambique agreed to collect toll revenue to repay the loan. Then, on May 30, 2012, the Government of Mozambique ratified another buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement with China Eximbank worth $72,580,000 to provide supplemental funding for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project. (captured via Project ID#57131). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower purchased buyer\\u2019s credit insurance from Sinosure in support of the loan.  The Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project involved the construction of a 3 kilometer long and 48 meter high suspension bridge that connects the cities of Maputo and Katembe. It also involved the extension of 129 kilometer road from\\u00a0Katembe\\u00a0to the border town of Ponta do Ouro, and the upgrading of ta 63 kilometer road between Boane\\u00a0and\\u00a0Bela Vista (including bridges over the\\u00a0Maputo,\\u00a0Futi\\u00a0and\\u00a0Umbel\\u00fazi\\u00a0rivers).   China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) and the Maputo Development Corporation (Maputo-Sul) were the entities responsible for implementation. An official groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 20, 2012.  However, construction did not begin in earnest until June 6, 2014 and the project encountered several major problems and delays. Maputo-Sul and CRBC employed more than 3,800 local workers and 500 Chinese workers. However, local workers organized protests in 2014 due to poor working conditions and late payments of salaries. The construction of the bridge also required the resettlement of 900 families and stallholders from the Nwankakakana market. Initially, insufficient compensation was offered to the concerned parties; however, extra funds were eventually allocated for building houses for the families and remunerating stallholders. The project was originally scheduled for completion on June 25, 2018 but it was ultimately completed on November 10, 2018.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique\\u2019s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283).\",\"On April 28, 2016, China Eximbank signed three different loan agreements with the Government of Pakistan for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi\\u2013Lahore Motorway Project. The proceeds of the BCL, GCL, and PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a $2,889,798,643 commercial contract between the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s National Highway Authority and China State Construction Engineering Corporation Limited (CSCEC), which was signed on December 25, 2015. The $361,224,830.37 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [CHINA Eximbank loan ID#1410202052016210417 and Government of Pakistan loan ID#BCL-16MWAY-CPEC] is captured in Project ID #54415. The borrowing terms are as follows: 5.2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, 5-year grace period, 0.75% ($2,709,186.23) management fee, and 0.5% commitment fee. The RMB 4.8 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2016) 7 TOTAL NO. (576) or Government of Pakistan loan ID#GCL167576-CPEC] is captured in Project ID #39013. The borrowing terms include a 2% interest rate but the maturity and grace period is unknown. The $1,790,113,000 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2016) 10 TOTAL NO. (390) or Government of Pakistan loan ID#PBC1610398-CPEC] is captured in Project ID #54416. The borrowing terms include a 2% interest rate but the maturity and grace period is unknown.  The Karachi\\u2013Lahore Motorway (KLM) is a 1,694 km (1,053 mile), six-lane, high-speed, limited-access motorway that connects Karachi and Peshawar through Islamabad, Lahore, Multan and Sukkur. It is considered to be a major component of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The 387 km, six-lane Sukkur-Multan section of the motorway follows the left bank of River Indus and it involved the construction of 100 bridges, 468 underpasses, 991 culverts, 11 interchanges, six pairs of service areas, five pairs of rest areas, and 24 toll stations.  A revised feasibility study was completed for this project on June 18, 2014. China State Construction and Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on August 5, 2016, and the project was completed on November 5, 2019.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank government concessional loan for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi-Lahore Highway Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the government concessional loan agreement for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi-Lahore Highway Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-030]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the government concessional loan agreement for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi-Lahore Highway Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the government concessional loan agreement for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi-Lahore Highway Project. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2020-December 2020 is captured via Project ID#96254. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96256. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.\",\"On December 6, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Cote d'Ivoire signed a $793,390,000 (CFA 423,630,219,153.44) preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 43 TOTAL NO. (337)] for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project. The proceeds of the loan were then on-lent to the Abidjan Autonomous Port Authority (PAA). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was also required to maintain a minimum cash balance of CFA 3 billion in an escrow account (accessible to the lender).  The proceeds of the PBC were used to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $933.4 million EPC contract between Abidjan Autonomous Port Authority (PAA) and China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd. (CHEC), which was signed on January 11, 2013. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire was responsible for financing the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($140,010,000). African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) also arranged an EUR 250 million syndicated bridge loan facility in 2014 for this project.  According to the Government of C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), China Eximbank made 15 loan disbursements (worth CFA 459,375,056,353) between 2015 and 2020: a CFA 71,405,100,000 disbursement on September 30, 2015, a CFA 48,843,381,789 disbursement on April 30, 2016, a CFA 5,293,017,891 disbursement on June 30, 2016, a CFA 8,388,694,167 disbursement on October 31, 2016, a CFA 3,281,002,542 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a CFA 50,318,912,478 disbursement on December 31, 2016, a CFA 60,326,378,065 disbursement on December 31, 2017, a CFA 75,857,838,185 disbursement on October 31, 2018, a CFA 24,960,426,152 disbursement on May 31, 2019, a CFA 6,247,765,605 disbursement on September 30, 2019, a CFA 17,886,499,596 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a CFA 12,392,163,528 disbursement on December 31, 2019, a CFA 7,423,281,737 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a CFA 5,517,839,600 disbursement on April 30, 2010, and a CFA 61,232,755,018 disbursement on June 30, 2020.  The project involved the enlargement of the Vridi canal (a link from Abidjan to the Atlantic Ocean), the construction of a second container terminal, and a roll-on/roll-off terminal. It was expected to start in the first quarter of 2015 and reach completion by 2021.   CHEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 6, 2015. The roll-on/roll-off terminal was finished at some point in 2018. On February 21, 2019, the enlargement of Vridi Canal was officially completed and handed over to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire. The project as a whole was officially completed on April 23, 2020, and a certificate of final acceptance was issued by the project owner in July 2021. However, the construction of the second container terminal was not completed until November 25, 2022. The modern container terminal, roll-on/roll-off terminal, jetties, and approach channels that were expanded and improved with financing from China Eximbank have reportedly increased the cargo handling capacity and efficiency of the port.  This project suffered from major cash flow problems. According to the Government of C\\u00f4te d'Ivoire\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), PAA had payment arrears to CHEC worth CFA 186 billion (China Eximbank share: CFA 165 billion; PAA share: CFA 21 billion) as of November 14, 2017. The AMP also notes that, as of November 14, 2017, the project was generating large financial outflows but it was not expected to generate revenue until 2020. To increase PAA\\u2019s revenue-generation capacity, the Ivorian authorities considered putting in place a special tax and customs regime (in accordance with Articles 4 and 43 of the PAA statutes) from 2020 to 2035. It is unclear if they ultimately did so. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire and PAA also secured an EUR 10,641,840 agreement with Matha Capital, JP Morgan, Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale Paris, and Ecobank to hedge its foreign exchange (USD/CFA) risk on its outstanding debt to China Eximbank for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project.\",\"On August 10, 2010, the China-Africa Development Fund (CADF), Sinohydro Corporation Ltd., and the Government of Zambia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract for the Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Power Station Project. The project was designed to address a power deficit in Zambia. It would involve the construction of a 140-meter high concrete-face rock fill dam (CFRD) with a length of approximately 378 meters. A surface powerhouse and five generator units would also be built. It was originally envisaged that the project would be completed by 2021 and created approximately 5,000 jobs. China Development Bank (CDB) was slated to provided financing to the project. The total cost of the project was reported to be $2 billion at the time. China\\u2019s Ministry of Commerce announced that a commencement ceremony for the project was scheduled for July 20, 2011.   However, after a change of government in 2011, Zambia\\u2019s incoming Minister of Finance questioned whether the project would be sufficiently beneficial to Zambia and whether there were adequate transparency and control mechanisms in place. He wanted a second opinion regarding the technical solutions proposed by the Chinese side. The Government of Norway was asked to review the plans and give further advice, but the Norwegian Government did not wish to be involved. The Government of Zambia nevertheless decided to \\u2018unpack\\u2019 the original proposal and looked for alternative funding and investors. It suspended its MOU with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and CADF.   However, after an open tendering process, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. re-won the EPC contract on October 19, 2015. The project was ultimately financed as a public-private partnership (PPP) with a 85:15 debt-to-equity ratio. A special purpose vehicle called the Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited (KGLPDC) was created to manage the implementation of this PPP. It is wholly-owned by Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) Limited, a state-owned power company. Then, on November 13, 2017, Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited signed a $1,530,576,039.16 syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit facility agreement with China Eximbank and ICBC for the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Power Plant Construction Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. ZESCO Limited reportedly agreed to cover the remaining 15% through an equity contribution, even though it had already made an $186 million equity investment in the project (with some of the proceeds from a $750 million Eurobond issuance in September 2012). China Eximbank\\u2019s estimated contribution to the loan is captured via Project ID#57536 and ICBC\\u2019s estimated contribution to the loan is captured via Project ID#92289. The final facility (loan) agreement included 87 loan conditions, none of which has been made public. Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. reportedly pushed to help the Government of Zambia complete all conditions before the syndicate would commit to finalizing the facility agreement. Zambia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance provided a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and Sinosure provided a credit insurance policy (which cost the borrower approximately $100 million).   The loan had disbursed $479,000,000 as of June 21, 2018, $551,291,040 as of December 31, 2018, $887,520,697 as of December 31, 2019, $932,015,102 as of December 31, 2020, and $1,200,000,000 as of January 2020. The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was $965,692,012 (inclusive of $16,843,994 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2021, $981,586,149 (inclusive of $32,738,132 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2022, and $993,836,899 (inclusive of $44,988,881 in interest arrears) as of December 31, 2022.  Construction began on January 15, 2016. However, the first loan disbursement (worth $479 million) from China Eximbank and ICBC did not occur until June 21, 2018. ZESCO Limited also hired a Norwegian private company, Norconsult, to act as its technical advisor and quality controller to ensure that Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and other contractors honor their contractual obligations and international standards. BelFone Communications was contracted to a wireless communication system for the plant. Significant progress was made between 2016 and 2019: the North Western Province was connected to the national electricity grid following the commissioning of a 132 KV transmission line; costly diesel generation machines were decommissioned; and other transmission lines were completed to support mining projects in the region. The project had achieved a 72% completion rate by early 2020. However, the project experienced major delays in late 2019 when Sinohydro announced that it was halting its work due to the fact that it had not been paid for its services. Also, in later 2019 and early 2020, ICBC was reportedly reluctant to continue making loan disbursements due to the fact that the Government of Zambia had defaulted on its repayment obligations to several other external creditors.  Then, in January 2020, China\\u2019s Ambassador to Zambia refuted reports by Africa Confidential that the project\\u2019s lenders had suspended disbursements, resulting in a stoppage of works at the hydropower plant.  However, later that year, KGLPDC defaulted on its repayment obligations under the facility (buyer\\u2019s credit) agreement with ICBC and China Eximbank. Given that the buyer\\u2019s credit was insured by Sinosure, the EPC contractor (Sinohydro Corporation Ltd.) sought compensation through an indemnity payment. In January 2021, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. filed an insurance claim with Sinosure, which in turn made an indemnity payment (worth $57.23 million) to Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. in May 2021.   The COVID-19 pandemic and major cost overruns also led to project implementation delays. The cost of the EPC contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. reportedly increased from $1.48 billion to $2 billion, and interest payments worth $312 million during the grace period were reportedly capitalized so that the borrower would not have to make loan repayments until the power plant began generating revenue. In July 2021, during the middle of Zambia\\u2019s presidential election campaign season, one of the five turbines (Turbine Number 2) of the 750 MW Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant was commercially commissioned and it began to supply 150 MW to the national grid. As of April 2022, ZESCO reported that two turbines at the power plant were operational and producing 300 megawatts while a third turbine was undergoing a reliability test, but there was an apparent lack of activity at the project site and neither China Eximbank nor ICBC were making any loan disbursements.  Then, in June 2022, Zambia's Energy Minister Peter Kapala announced that Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited had defaulted on its repayment obligations to China Eximbank and ICBC, and it was seeking to reschedule and restructure its outstanding debts to the Chinese creditors. He also announced that ZESCO would use internal revenues to complete the project and ensure that all turbines came online. One month later, in July 2022, China\\u2019s Ambassador to Zambia, Du Xiaohui, referred to the Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant as a \\u2018a money printer made in China\\u2019 that could potentially early $1 million a day. On March 24, 2023, the fifth turbine was launched and the entire project was officially commissioned in a ceremony attended by President of Zambia Hakainde Hichilema. However, there were reports that ZESCO commissioned the plant later in late April 2023.\",\"On August 10, 2010, the China-Africa Development Fund (CADF), Sinohydro Corporation Ltd., and the Government of Zambia signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract for the Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Power Station Project.

China\\u2019s Ministry of Commerce announced that a commencement ceremony for the project was scheduled for July 20, 2011.   However, after a change of government in 2011, Zambia\\u2019s incoming Minister of Finance questioned whether the project would be sufficiently beneficial to Zambia and whether there were adequate transparency and control mechanisms in place. He wanted a second opinion regarding the technical solutions proposed by the Chinese side. The Government of Norway was asked to review the plans and give further advice, but the Norwegian Government did not wish to be involved. The Government of Zambia nevertheless decided to \\u2018unpack\\u2019 the original proposal and looked for alternative funding and investors. It suspended its MOU with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and CADF.   However, after an open tendering process, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. re-won the EPC contract on October 19, 2015. The project was ultimately financed as a public-private partnership (PPP) with a 85:15 debt-to-equity ratio. A special purpose vehicle called the Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited (KGLPDC) was created to manage the implementation of this PPP. It is wholly-owned by Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) Limited, a state-owned power company. Then, on November 13, 2017, Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited signed a $1,530,576,039.16 syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit facility agreement with China Eximbank and ICBC for the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Power Plant Construction Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. ZESCO Limited reportedly agreed to cover the remaining 15% through an equity contribution, even though it had already made an $186 million equity investment in the project (with some of the proceeds from a $750 million Eurobond issuance in September 2012). China Eximbank\\u2019s estimated contribution to the loan is captured via Project ID#57536 and ICBC\\u2019s estimated contribution to the loan is captured via Project ID#92289. The final facility (loan) agreement included 87 loan conditions, none of which has been made public. Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. reportedly pushed to help the Government of Zambia complete all conditions before the syndicate would commit to finalizing the facility agreement. Zambia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance provided a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and Sinosure provided a credit insurance policy (which cost the borrower approximately $100 million).   The loan had disbursed $479,000,000 as of June 21, 2018, $551,291,040 as of December 31, 2018, $887,520,697 as of December 31, 2019, $932,015,102 as of December 31, 2020, and $1,200,000,000 as of January 2020. The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was $965,692,012 (inclusive of $16,843,994 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2021, $981,586,149 (inclusive of $32,738,132 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2022, and $993,836,899 (inclusive of $44,988,881 in interest arrears) as of December 31, 2022.  Construction began on January 15, 2016. However, the first loan disbursement (worth $479 million) from China Eximbank and ICBC did not occur until June 21, 2018. ZESCO Limited also hired a Norwegian private company, Norconsult, to act as its technical advisor and quality controller to ensure that Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and other contractors honor their contractual obligations and international standards. BelFone Communications was contracted to a wireless communication system for the plant. Significant progress was made between 2016 and 2019: the North Western Province was connected to the national electricity grid following the commissioning of a 132 KV transmission line; costly diesel generation machines were decommissioned; and other transmission lines were completed to support mining projects in the region. The project had achieved a 72% completion rate by early 2020. However, the project experienced major delays in late 2019 when Sinohydro announced that it was halting its work due to the fact that it had not been paid for its services. Also, in later 2019 and early 2020, ICBC was reportedly reluctant to continue making loan disbursements due to the fact that the Government of Zambia had defaulted on its repayment obligations to several other external creditors.  Then, in January 2020, China\\u2019s Ambassador to Zambia refuted reports by Africa Confidential that the project\\u2019s lenders had suspended disbursements, resulting in a stoppage of works at the hydropower plant.  However, later that year, KGLPDC defaulted on its repayment obligations under the facility (buyer\\u2019s credit) agreement with ICBC and China Eximbank. Given that the buyer\\u2019s credit was insured by Sinosure, the EPC contractor (Sinohydro Corporation Ltd.) sought compensation through an indemnity payment. In January 2021, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. filed an insurance claim with Sinosure, which in turn made an indemnity payment (worth $57.23 million) to Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. in May 2021.   The COVID-19 pandemic and major cost overruns also led to project implementation delays. The cost of the EPC contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. reportedly increased from $1.48 billion to $2 billion, and interest payments worth $312 million during the grace period were reportedly capitalized so that the borrower would not have to make loan repayments until the power plant began generating revenue. In July 2021, during the middle of Zambia\\u2019s presidential election campaign season, one of the five turbines (Turbine Number 2) of the 750 MW Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant was commercially commissioned and it began to supply 150 MW to the national grid. As of April 2022, ZESCO reported that two turbines at the power plant were operational and producing 300 megawatts while a third turbine was undergoing a reliability test, but there was an apparent lack of activity at the project site and neither China Eximbank nor ICBC were making any loan disbursements.  Then, in June 2022, Zambia's Energy Minister Peter Kapala announced that Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited had defaulted on its repayment obligations to China Eximbank and ICBC, and it was seeking to reschedule and restructure its outstanding debts to the Chinese creditors. He also announced that ZESCO would use internal revenues to complete the project and ensure that all turbines came online. One month later, in July 2022, China\\u2019s Ambassador to Zambia, Du Xiaohui, referred to the Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant as a \\u2018a money printer made in China\\u2019 that could potentially early $1 million a day. On March 24, 2023, the fifth turbine was launched and the entire project was officially commissioned in a ceremony attended by President of Zambia Hakainde Hichilema. However, there were reports that ZESCO commissioned the plant later in late April 2023.\",\"On June 6, 2019, SINOPEC and SIBUR signed a framework agreement for the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project, which established a special purpose vehicle (SPV) known as Amur Gas Chemical Complex LLC (AGCC) (\\u0410\\u043c\\u0443\\u0440\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0433\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0445\\u0438\\u043c\\u0438\\u0447\\u0435\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043c\\u043f\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0441 (\\u0410\\u0413\\u0425\\u041a). AGCC is a joint venture of Sinopec (40% ownership stake and SIBUR 60% ownership stake. It secured a $1.5 billion bridge loan from a syndicated of Russian banks in December 2020.     Then, sometime between December 1-8, 2021, AGCC signed a series of syndicated loan agreements worth $9.1 billion with Chinese and non-Chinese banks for the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project: a $1.201 billion, 14-year loan from Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole Group, Intesa Sanpaolo, Citigroup, DZ Bank, Helaba, and Unicredit backed by a Euler Hermes insurance policy; a $964.36 million, 14-year loan from Unicredit, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole Group, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, and Intesa Sanpaolo backed by a SACE insurance policy; a $2.064 billion loan from Gazprombank, Sberbank, Otkritie FC Bank, and Alfa-Bank without an insurance policy; and a $4.6 billion loan from China Development Bank (CDB), China Eximbank, Bank of China (BoC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) without an insurance policy. The loan from CDB, China Eximbank, BoC, CCB, and ICBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2.6% margin, and a default (penalty) interest rate of 2%. The lenders have a formal security interest in a special bank (collateral) account, which was established on December 13, 2021 by AGCC (pledgor) and Gazprombank (account bank).  The Chinese state-owned bank contributions to the $4.6 billion syndicated loan are captured by the following Project IDs: CDB via Project ID#90926; China Eximbank via Project ID#92660, BOC via Project ID#92661, CCB via Project ID#92662, and ICBC via Project ID#92663.    The purpose of the project is to construct a petrochemical project, located in the Amur Region, close to the Chinese border in Russia. It involves the construction of a basic polymer production facility with a combined capacity of 2.7 million metric tons per year (MMt/y), comprising 2.3 MMt/y of polyethylene (PE) and 400,000 metric tons of polypropylene (PP). Upon completion, the plant will have one pyrolysis plant that can generate 2.7 million tons a year of ethylene and propylene, one plant for producing 0.4 million tons of polypropylene a year, three units producing a total of 1.8 million tons of polyethylene, one butene-1 production plant for producing 0.0555 million tons a year, 1 plant for the production of polyethylene with a capacity of 0.5 million tons per year, and OZH facilities and infrastructure.     The Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project is closely related to the Chinese bank-financed Amur Gas Processing Plant Construction Project (captured via Project ID#66306, #92611, and #92612), which will provide the raw material for the Amur Gas Chemical Complex, including two million tons of ethane fraction a year. NIPIGAS (\\u041d\\u0418\\u041f\\u0418\\u0413\\u0410\\u0417) is the general design contractor for the construction of the Amur Gas Chemical Complex. It has worked in a consortium with Linde to procure pyrolysis units. On May 5, 2020, Technimont S.p.A. \\u2014 a subsidiary of Maire Technimont \\u2014 signed an EPSS (Engineering, Procurement and Site Services) contract worth EUR 1.2 billion with AGCC. Technimont S.p.A is the leader of a consortium that includes MT Russia LLC, Sinopec Engineering Inc. and Sinopec Engineering Group Co., Ltd Russian Branch.     The project\\u2019s groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 18, 2020. By the end of March 2022, the project had achieved a completion rate of 37.8%. However, in March 2022, Linde suspended its involvement in the project after Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Then, in April 2022, SIBUR and Sinopec announced plans to \\u2018revise\\u2019 their strategy for the project in the wake of new sanctions on Russia. The project\\u2019s originally expected completion date was May 2024.  There are some indications that the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from \\u2018unfriendly states\\u2019\\u2014including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine\\u2014in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. Then, in June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt. The fact that two of AGCC's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 also reportedly complicated the implementation of the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project.\",\"On June 6, 2019, SINOPEC and SIBUR signed a framework agreement for the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project, which established a special purpose vehicle (SPV) known as Amur Gas Chemical Complex LLC (AGCC) (\\u0410\\u043c\\u0443\\u0440\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0433\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0445\\u0438\\u043c\\u0438\\u0447\\u0435\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043c\\u043f\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0441 (\\u0410\\u0413\\u0425\\u041a).

The Chinese state-owned bank contributions to the $4.6 billion syndicated loan are captured by the following Project IDs: CDB via Project ID#90926; China Eximbank via Project ID#92660, BOC via Project ID#92661, CCB via Project ID#92662, and ICBC via Project ID#92663.    The purpose of the project is to construct a petrochemical project, located in the Amur Region, close to the Chinese border in Russia. It involves the construction of a basic polymer production facility with a combined capacity of 2.7 million metric tons per year (MMt/y), comprising 2.3 MMt/y of polyethylene (PE) and 400,000 metric tons of polypropylene (PP). Upon completion, the plant will have one pyrolysis plant that can generate 2.7 million tons a year of ethylene and propylene, one plant for producing 0.4 million tons of polypropylene a year, three units producing a total of 1.8 million tons of polyethylene, one butene-1 production plant for producing 0.0555 million tons a year, 1 plant for the production of polyethylene with a capacity of 0.5 million tons per year, and OZH facilities and infrastructure.     The Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project is closely related to the Chinese bank-financed Amur Gas Processing Plant Construction Project (captured via Project ID#66306, #92611, and #92612), which will provide the raw material for the Amur Gas Chemical Complex, including two million tons of ethane fraction a year. NIPIGAS (\\u041d\\u0418\\u041f\\u0418\\u0413\\u0410\\u0417) is the general design contractor for the construction of the Amur Gas Chemical Complex. It has worked in a consortium with Linde to procure pyrolysis units. On May 5, 2020, Technimont S.p.A. \\u2014 a subsidiary of Maire Technimont \\u2014 signed an EPSS (Engineering, Procurement and Site Services) contract worth EUR 1.2 billion with AGCC. Technimont S.p.A is the leader of a consortium that includes MT Russia LLC, Sinopec Engineering Inc. and Sinopec Engineering Group Co., Ltd Russian Branch.     The project\\u2019s groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 18, 2020. By the end of March 2022, the project had achieved a completion rate of 37.8%. However, in March 2022, Linde suspended its involvement in the project after Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Then, in April 2022, SIBUR and Sinopec announced plans to \\u2018revise\\u2019 their strategy for the project in the wake of new sanctions on Russia. The project\\u2019s originally expected completion date was May 2024.  There are some indications that the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from \\u2018unfriendly states\\u2019\\u2014including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine\\u2014in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. Then, in June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt. The fact that two of AGCC's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 also reportedly complicated the implementation of the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project.\",\"On June 6, 2019, SINOPEC and SIBUR signed a framework agreement for the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project, which established a special purpose vehicle (SPV) known as Amur Gas Chemical Complex LLC (AGCC) (\\u0410\\u043c\\u0443\\u0440\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0433\\u0430\\u0437\\u043e\\u0445\\u0438\\u043c\\u0438\\u0447\\u0435\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0439 \\u043a\\u043e\\u043c\\u043f\\u043b\\u0435\\u043a\\u0441 (\\u0410\\u0413\\u0425\\u041a). AGCC is a joint venture of Sinopec (40% ownership stake and SIBUR 60% ownership stake. It secured a $1.5 billion bridge loan from a syndicated of Russian banks in December 2020.     Then, sometime between December 1-8, 2021, AGCC signed a series of syndicated loan agreements worth $9.1 billion with Chinese and non-Chinese banks for the Amur Gas Chemical Complex Construction Project: a $1.201 billion, 14-year loan from Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole Group, Intesa Sanpaolo, Citigroup, DZ Bank, Helaba, and Unicredit backed by a Euler Hermes insurance policy; a $964.36 million, 14-year loan from Unicredit, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank, Credit Agricole Group, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, and Intesa Sanpaolo backed by a SACE insurance policy; a $2.064 billion loan from Gazprombank, Sberbank, Otkritie FC Bank, and Alfa-Bank without an insurance policy; and a $4.6 billion loan from China Development Bank (CDB), China Eximbank, Bank of China (BoC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) without an insurance policy. The loan from CDB, China Eximbank, BoC, CCB, and ICBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2.6% margin, and a default (penalty) interest rate of 2%.

(20% ownership stake), and China's CNPC (20% ownership stake) and Silk Road Fund (9.9% ownership stake) \\u2014 for the Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The facility agreement was amended on April 29, 2016. The financing from CDB and China Eximbank is part of the project finance package totaling the equivalent of $18.4 billion.  The total cost of the project is approximately $36 billion and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. The project reached financial close with CDB and China Eximbank in June 2016.   CDB issued both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67064) was worth EUR 5,057,800,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67063) was worth RMB 5,286,000,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%.   China Eximbank provided both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67062) was worth EUR 4,279,700,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67041) was worth RMB 4,472,500,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%.   In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069).   The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant \\u2014 with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field \\u2014 located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek \\u2014 Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer \\u2014 to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia\\u2019s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called \\u201cNational Wealth Fund\\u201d). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019\\u20132021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (\\u5927\\u9023\\u4e2d\\u9060\\u6d77\\u904b\\u6cb9\\u54c1\\u904b\\u8f38\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: \\u00ab\\u042d\\u0434\\u0443\\u0430\\u0440\\u0434 \\u0422\\u043e\\u043b\\u043b\\u044c\\u00bb), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0420\\u0443\\u0434\\u043e\\u043b\\u044c\\u0444 \\u0421\\u0430\\u043c\\u043e\\u0439\\u043b\\u043e\\u0432\\u0438\\u0447\\u00bb), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: \\u00ab\\u041d\\u0438\\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u0430\\u0439 \\u0415\\u0432\\u0433\\u0435\\u043d\\u043e\\u0432\\u00bb), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0412\\u043b\\u0430\\u0434\\u0438\\u043c\\u0438\\u0440 \\u0412\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u043d\\u0438\\u043d\\u00bb) all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0413\\u0435\\u043e\\u0440\\u0433\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0423\\u0448\\u0430\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432\\u00bb) which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: \\u00ab\\u042f\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432 \\u0413\\u0430\\u043a\\u043a\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u00bb) which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (\\u682a\\u5f0f\\u4f1a\\u793e\\u5546\\u8239\\u4e09\\u4e95). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsv\\u00e5g, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from \\u2018unfriendly states\\u2019\\u2014including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine\\u2014in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia\\u2019s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia\\u2019s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany\\u2019s Euler Hermes, Sweden\\u2019s EKN, Austria\\u2019s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China\\u2019s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia\\u2019s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'\",\"On June 20, 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China ('China Eximbank') and the Government of Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance signed a financing agreement for the Songo Songo to Dar Es Salaam Gas Pipeline and Natural Gas Processing Plants at Mnazi Bay and Songo Songo Project. Two loans were issued to Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance: a $275 million buyer's credit loan (BCL) with an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 430 basis points, a 1.83-year (22 month) grace period, and a 12.83-year (154 month) maturity and a $920 million preferential\\u2019s buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) with a 20-year maturity, a 7-year (84 month) grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The PBC (captured via Project ID#59752) was scheduled for semi-annual repayment every January 21 and July 21. It had a grace period of 84 months from the first loan disbursement date (June 20, 2013) and it was scheduled to be repaid in full 156 months from the end of the grace period. The BCL (captured via Project ID#59733) was scheduled for semi-annual repayment every January 21 and July 21. It had a grace period of 22 months from the first loan disbursement date (July 24, 2013) and it was scheduled to be repaid in full 132 months from the end of the grace period.  The PBC and BCL proceeds were on-lent from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance to the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), which in turn used the proceeds to finance a September 2011 commercial (EPC) contract with China Petroleum Technology and Development Corporation (CPTDC), a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company (CNPC).  The PBC and BCL were both secured with (i.e. collateralized against) all rights under a natural gas sales agreement between the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) and TPDC. The borrower (Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance) and end-user (TPDC) was required to deposit profits from the gas pipeline into three Stanbic Bank escrow accounts that were accessible to the lender. According to TPDC\\u2019s audited financial statements, the escrow accounts \\u2018were opened to secure repayment of principal and payment of interest and fees under the loan agreements\\u2019 and the minimum cash balances in these accounts functioned as sources of \\u2018collateral\\u2019. TPDC and Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance maintained a cash balance of TZS 42,011,517,702 in the escrow accounts as of June 30, 2014, TZS 120,509,276,347 as of June 30, 2015 (TZS 2,380,765,097 from TPDC and TZS 118,128,511,250 from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance), $60,340,466 (TZS 131,473,427,000) as of June 30, 2016 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance), $60,340,466 as of June 30, 2017, $60,320,710 (TZS 136,713,000,000) as of June 30, 2018, $60,320,710 (TZS 138,105,000,000) as of June 30, 2019 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance), $60,320,710 (TZS 138,527,000,000) as of June 30, 2020 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance), and $60,320,710 (TZS 138,673,000,000) as of June 30, 2021 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania\\u2019s Ministry of Finance). China Eximbank conducted a small \\u2018cash sweep\\u2019 (worth $19,806) from one of the escrow accounts between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018. It withdrew these funds \\u2018as a penalty for [the Government of Tanzania\\u2019s] late repayment of due installment.\\u2019  The first PBC disbursement took place on June 20, 2013. The first BCL disbursement took place on July 24, 2013. Another loan disbursement (worth $126,495,423.10) took place in August 2014. The proceeds of the BCL and PBC were earmarked for the following sub-projects: (a) $151,735,000 for the Songo Songo Natural Gas Plant; (b) $197,877,000 for the Mnazi Bay Natural Gas Plant; and (c) $875,715,000 for the Natural Gas Pipeline.  The PBC\\u2019s outstanding amount was TZS 353,208,000,000 as of July 1, 2013, TZS 929,156,000,000 as of June 30, 2014, TZS 1,689,444,000,000 as of June 30, 2015, TZS 2,075,037,000,000 as of June 30, 2016, TZS 2,180,592,000,000 as of June 30, 2017, TZS 2,261,433,000,000 as of June 30, 2018, TZS 2,330,382,000,000 as of June 30, 2019, TZS 2,382,841,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, and TZS 2,428,269,000,000 as of June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2016, TPDC disclosed in an audited financial statement that it had defaulted on its repayment obligations under the PBC because it had not made an interest payments to the Government of Tanzania.  As of June 30, 2021, TPDC disclosed in an audited financial statement that it had not made any principal or interest payments on the PBC to the Government of Tanzania (despite the fact that the PBC\\u2019s grace period expired on June 20, 2020).  The BCL\\u2019s outstanding amount was TZS 0 as of July 1, 2013, TZS 165,451,000,000 as of June 30, 2014, TZS 488,968,000,000 as of June 30, 2015, TZS 648,979,000,000 as of June 30, 2016, TZS 717,819,000,000 as of June 30, 2017, TZS 768,040,000,000 as of June 30, 2018, TZS 811,358,000,000 as of June 30, 2019, TZS 845,584,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, and TZS 875,830,000,000 as of June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2016, TPDC disclosed in an audited financial statement that it had defaulted on its repayment obligations under the BCL because it had not made an interest payments to the Government of Tanzania. As of June 30, 2021, TPDC disclosed in an audited financial statement that it had not made any principal or interest payments on the BCL to the Government of Tanzania (despite the fact that the BCL\\u2019s grace period expired on May 24, 2015).  The gas pipeline project was designed and constructed to deliver natural gas to Dar es Salaam for use in power generation, industrial applications, household cooking and in propulsion of transport vehicles. It involved the construction of a 542 kilometer marine and terrestrial pipeline between Songo Songo and Dar Es Salaam as well as two processing plants: one in Songo Songo and another in Mnazi Bay.   The 542-kilometer gas pipeline has four parts: (i) 290-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Madimba in Mtwara to Somanga Fungu; (ii) 25-kilometer marine pipeline of 24-inches from Songo Songo Island to Somanga Fungu; (iii) 197-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Somanga Fungu to Kinyerezi in Dar es Salaam; and (iv) 30-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 16-inches diameter from Kinyerezi to Tegeta in Dar es Salaam. It passes through 1 marine park, 4 regions, 8 districts, 41 wards and 113 villages. The capacity of the main (36 inch) pipeline is rated at 784 million standard cubic feet per day, according to the Natural Gas Utilization Master Plan 2016-2045, but can handle up to 1002 million standard cubic feet per day with compression. It is the longest gas pipeline that has ever been constructed in Tanzania.  CPTDC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction was officially launched on November 8, 2012 and the Tanzanian President inaugurated the constructed pipeline on October 10, 2015. The pipeline was originally scheduled for a completion date in 2014.   Loan repayment was originally expected to depend on gas sales upon completion of the pipeline construction and after the project's commercial operation date (COD). However, a review of the on-lending agreements, Gas Sales Agreements (GSA), and pipeline construction contract revealed that the pipeline was constructed before pre-identification and pre-signing of gas sales agreements between Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and its expected major gas customers. This anomaly had an effect on loan repayment as actual gas sales came in far below the initial projection of 138.8 million standard cubic feet per day. In fact, according to a report published by the Government of Tanzania's Controller and Auditor General (CAG), TANESCO was the only gas consumer as of March 2017 -- with a consumption average of 46.61 million standard cubic feet per day instead of the agreed amount of at least 80 million standard cubic feet per day as per the GSA between TPDC and TANESCO.  There are also indications that the China Eximbank loans that were issued for the Songo Songo to Dar Es Salaam Gas Pipeline and Natural Gas Processing Plants at Mnazi Bay and Songo Songo Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives and the original expectations of the lender. Tanzania's National Audit Office (NAO) warned of 'Financial Distress Facing TPDC Due to Non-Settlement of TANESCO Long Outstanding Bills TZS 248 Billion' in its Annual General Report on the Audit of Public Authorities and other Bodies for the financial year 2016/2017. More specifically, the NAO noted that 'TPDC and TANESCO entered into a Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) in September 2015 whereby the TANESCO buys natural gas from TPDC for power generation at Kinyerezi, Ubungo II and Symbion Power Plants. I have noted that between September 2015 and December 2017 monthly invoices totaling to TZS 567,514,961,312.95. (USD 254,448,796.08), were issued by TPDC to TANESCO with respects to the natural gas supplied to TANESCO for power generation. My audit noted that by December 2017, TANESCO had managed to settle TZS 318,904,743,618.61 (USD 142,982,887.87) equivalent to 56% of the total amount of invoices leaving TZS 248,610,217,694.34 (USD 111,465,908.21) unsettled. TPDC may not be able to service the loan obtained to facilitate construction of Mtwara-Dar Gas Pipeline from EXIM Bank of China and their respective interests, if TANESCO does not settle this liability. Failure to repay the loan shall subject the Corporation to a compounded interest of 0.8% charged on the unpaid loan balance which will increase financial cost to TPDC and the Government. Further, failure to pay the loan shall amount to transfer of TPDC rights under the Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) to EXIM Bank of China as per Clause 2 of the Security Assignment Contractual Rights which forms of the Agreement signed between TPDC and EXIM Bank of China. The Government through Ministry of Finance and Planning and Ministry of Energy should consider assisting TANESCO in their efforts to settle such long outstanding dues which in turn will help TPDC meet gas purchase and other operational costs.' TPDC\\u2019s audited financial statements also indicate that, as the ultimate borrower/end user, it had fallen into arrears by 2017/2018. TPDC\\u2019s audited financial statements for the year ending on June 30, 2018 note that China Eximbank withdrew $19,806 from one of the escrow accounts between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 as a penalty for the borrower\\u2019s \\u2018late repayment of [a] due installment\\u2019. Then, in June 2019, TPDC announced that it was still having difficulty servicing its debts to the Government of Tanzania and it began to lobby for \\u2018debt relief\\u2019 \\u2014 that is, for the Government of Tanzania to shoulder the responsibility of loan repayment instead of TPDC.\",\"On May 15, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $2,490,760,000 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project. The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The loan was also backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (SINOSURE). China Eximbank provided the loan in three separate loan tranches. The first tranche is worth $1,289,029,000 (captured via Project ID#70086) and it supported the Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project. The second tranche is worth $981,260,000 (captured via Project ID#70085) and it supported the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project.  The third tranche is worth $220,471,000 (captured via Project ID#70083) and it supported the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $1,289,029,000 China Eximbank loan tranche to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,841,470,000.00 commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), which was signed on October 25, 2011 (and modified on November 5, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 15, 2013) to support the construction of a 329 km Sebeta (Addis Ababa) to Miesso section of the railway. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $981,260,000 China Eximbank loan to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,401,800,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the ERC and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on December 16, 2011 (and modified on modified on November 2, 2012, February 7, 2013 and March 8, 2013) to support the construction of a 339 km section of the railway that runs from Miesso (Meiso) to Dewelle (Dewanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $220,471,000 China Eximbank loan to finance approximately 85% of a $259 million commercial contract between China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and the ERC, which was signed in March 2013 to support the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The purpose of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east \\u2014 via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso \\u2014 to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The purpose of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was to acquire 5 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives, 30 railway passenger cars and 1,100 railway freight cars for the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway.  * Loan Disbursements: According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $1,289,029,000 (ETB 24,004,264,432) loan tranche for the Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 14 loan disbursements (worth ETB 24,905,259,256) between 2014 and 2020: an ETB 1,062,992,126 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 5,420,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,303,030,303 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 5,597,115,886 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 1,808,159 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 1,740,583,177 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 825,731,677 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 2,165,153,034 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 143,690,666 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 923,238,863 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 325,274,645 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 372,159,087 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB  1,422,471,270 disbursement on September 20, 2017, and an ETB 2,602,010,364 disbursement on November 12, 2020. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP, the $981,260,000 (ETB 18,272,998,138) loan tranche for the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 75% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth ETB 13,669,737,755 ) between 2014 and 2017: an ETB 5,580,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,585,858,586 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 1,515,331,236 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 243,681,645 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 1,660,143,553 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 1,092,814,700 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 448,108,619 disbursement on January 7, 2017, and an ETB 543,799,417 disbursement on July 7, 2017. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $220,471,000 (ETB 4,105,605,214) loan tranche for the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project achieved a 115% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 12 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,738,085,121) between 2014 and 2021: an ETB 665,417,485 disbursement on December 4, 2014, an ETB 160,812,787 disbursement on August 4, 2015, an ETB 153,698,778 disbursement on September 8, 2015, an ETB 59,771,749 disbursement on December 14, 2015, an ETB 102,465,859 disbursement on December 21, 2015, an ETB 91,306,426 disbursement on February 18, 2016, an ETB 119,581,905 disbursement on May 26, 2015, an ETB 1,969,772,945 disbursement on June 8, 2016, an ETB 298,939,684 disbursement on October 28, 2016, an ETB 166,925,102 disbursement on April 6, 2017, an ETB 245,832,231 disbursement on June 21, 2019,  and an ETB 703,560,172 disbursement on January 20, 2021.  * Project Design:  The 759 km Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway (\\u2018Yali Railway\\u2019) is the only railway line connecting landlocked Ethiopia with a Djibouti Port. The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo\\u2013Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash\\u2013Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti\\u2013Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway\\u2019s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016).  The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015.  In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives \\u2014 that carry passengers and freight \\u2014  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and \\u4e2d\\u571f\\u96c6\\u56e2\\u4e0e\\u4e2d\\u94c1\\u4e8c\\u5c40\\u4e9a\\u5409\\u94c1\\u8def\\u8054\\u8425\\u4f53\\u516c\\u53f8) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project\\u2019s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs as well as revenues are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country\\u2019s GDP) had been restructured\\u2014and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country\\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country\\u2019s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  \\u2018Overvoltage\\u2019 problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.\",\"On December 1, 2015, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) and Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance signed a $997.7 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement for the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. It disbursed $200 million in June 2018, $129.6 million in 2020, $33.83 million in 2021, and $171.6 million in 2022.   The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $217,121,910.95 as of 2021.    Zimbabwe\\u2019s Ministry of Finance used the loan proceeds to on-lend to Hwange Electricity Supply Company (HESCO), which is a special purpose vehicle (project company) that is jointly owned by Zimbabwe Power Company (64% equity stake) and Sinohydro (36% equity stake). HESCO entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) to off-take electricity from the constructed Hwange 7 & 8 Thermal Power Station. HESCO is expected to service the China Eximbank PBC with revenue derived from power sales to ZETDC.    The total cost of the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project is $2.148 billion and it is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. Standard Bank (unknown amount) and AfreximBank ($176 million) are the other sources of debt financing. 85% of the cost of HESCO\\u2019s engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro will be covered by the China Eximbank PBC. The remaining 15% ($176 million) will be provided through an equity contribution from Sinohydro. The purpose of the project is to construct Unit 7 and Unit 8 at the Hwange Makomo Power Station, and thereby increase the power generation capacity of the Hwange Makomo Power Station from 600 MW to 1200 MW (through the addition of two power generation units). Hwange Makomo Power Station is a coal-fired power plant and the 14th largest thermal station in the Southern African region. It is adjacent to the Wankie Colliery Open Cast Mine.   The station was built in two stages. The first four power generation (4x120 MW) units were commissioned between 1983 and 1986 and the fifth and sixth power generation (2x220 MW) units were commissioned in 1986 and 1987. These six units are already functional and the station currently generates about 40% percent of the country\\u2019s electricity needs. Coal is delivered to the station by an overland conveyor belt which is 6 kilometers long from Hwange Colliery Company Limited (HCCL) as well as by trucks from Makomo and Coalbrick mines. Water that is piped 44 kilometers from the Zambezi River is pumped into two 150,000-cubic-meter reservoirs next to the station and conveyed by gravity to its point of use. Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and it has hired 2532 employees (620 Chinese workers and 1912 local workers) as well as 252 sub-contractor employees (including 217 local workers). After the PBC agreement with China Eximbank was signed on December 1, 2015, the lender demanded that the Government of Zimbabwe meet several conditions, including parliamentary ratification of the PBC; the establishment of a debt service reserve agreement (DSRA) between the Government of Zimbabwe, China Eximbank and HESCO; the establishment of a PPA between HESCO and Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC); the establishment of an agreement between Government of Zimbabwe and HESCO outlining the incentives for the project (in terms of taxation) and guaranteeing ZETDC\\u2019s payments to HESCO; the signing of a coal supply agreement between HESCO and Makomo Resources, and the signing of a limestone supply agreement between HESCO and PPC (Zimbabwe). These requirements led to project implementation delays.    The first loan disbursement from China Eximbank took place in June 2018, which paved the way for project commencement on August 1, 2018. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 42 months (February 1, 2022). A formal groundbreaking ceremony was organized on June 27, 2018. Then, on March 1, 2019, a foundation stone laying ceremony took place. As of November 2019, the project had achieved a 25% completion rate. Then, in September 2020, reports emerged that the borrower had failed to comply with the terms of its escrow account agreement with China Eximbank and it instead issued a savings bond as collateral (security) in favor of the lender. By February 2021, the project was running behind schedule; it had achieved a 58.29% completion rate (against a target completion rate of 78.5%). The delay was attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and unpaid invoices (IPC payments). As of April 2022, Forbes Chanakira, a project manager for the Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion, reported that the project had achieved an 84.2% completion (progress) rate. He reported that the turbines and generator sets for Unit 7 had been constructed and were awaiting commissioning. At that time, the boiler was about 93% complete and the coal stockyard was expected to be operational in May 2022. The boiler\\u2019s control system, the Distributed Control System (DCS), had also been activated. Hot commissioning, a process in which coal is used in the boiler to heat steam, was expected at the time to begin by July 2022. It was expected to last until November 2022 when the unit would be handed off.    Forbes Chanakira also stated in April 2022 that about 810 of the 875 transmission towers built between Hwange and Bulawayo had been placed. At the time, on the 368 km section between Hwange and Bulawayo, a new 400KV line \\u2014 that would run parallel to the current lines \\u2014 still needed to be built. The route had been separated into three sections: Bulawayo to Lupane, Lupane to Gwayi, and Gwayi to Hwange, where engineers were working on building towers alongside other construction work. At one point, this project had employed 450 people, but the project ultimately is expected to employ more than 3,000 people.\",\"On June 4, 2008, Reliance Communications Limited (RCOM) obtained a $750 million loan (Facility I) from China Development Bank (CDB) to fund its nationwide GSM rollout efforts. This loan carried a 10-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 1.8% margin. It was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) (1) a first pari passu charge over the present and future moveable plant and machinery and capital work in progress of, and all rights, title, interest, benefits, claims and demands under and in respect of all insurance contracts entered into in relation to these assets by Reliance Communications Limited, Reliance Communications Infrastructure Limited, Reliance Infratel Limited and Reliance Telecom Limited; (2) assignment of 20 unified access service licenses, a national long-distance license and an international long-distance license of Reliance Communications Limited; and (3) pledge of: (i) 66,980,095 equity shares of Reliance Telecom Limited held by Reliance Communications Limited; (ii) 18,019,900 equity shares of Reliance Telecom Limited held by Reliance Infocomm Infrastructure Limited; and (iii) 9,379,999,994 equity shares of Reliance Communications Infrastructure Limited held by Reliance Communications Limited.  The proceeds of this loan were reportedly used to finance RCOM's GSM equipment order placed with Huawei. As of December 31, 2014, the (principal) amount outstanding under this loan was $518 million.   In February 2019, Reliance Communications filed for bankruptcy as it was unable to sell assets to repay its debts.\",\"In 2012, China Eximbank and the Republic of Congo signed a $1 billion loan framework agreement (captured in Project ID#59273) \\u2014 also known in the Republic of Congo as the \\u201cstrategic partnership 2\\u201d (\\u201cpartenariat strat\\u00e9gique 2\\u201d) \\u2014 that allowed the Republic of Congo to obtain China Eximbank loans for infrastructure projects through a securitization mechanism: Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Nationales des P\\u00e9troles Congolais (SNPC)\\u2014the country\\u2019s state-owned oil company\\u2014agreed to deposit a portion of the cash proceeds from its oil exports into an escrow account that is controlled by China Eximbank. The borrower was required to keep a minimum deposit balance of 15-20% of total outstanding loans in an escrow account. All subsidiary loans approved through this framework agreement were to carry the following terms: a 5-year grace period, a 20-year maturity and a 0.25% interest rate.    According to the Congolese authorities, only one subsidiary loan was ultimately approved through this framework agreement: a $1 billion loan in 2012 for the Dolisie-Brazzavile Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#369). The loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding was $1,000,000,000 as of December 31, 2019.  This project, which is also known as Phase 2 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project, involved the construction of a 376 km road segment along National Route 1 (NR1) between Dolisie and PK45 north of Brazzaville.    China Eximbank also issued multiple loans for Phase 1 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#68874, ID#72780, ID#72781, and ID#72782). China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of Phase 1 and Phase 2.    The groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 2 took place on December 22, 2011. Phase 2 was completed on October 3, 2015. The four-lane, 535 km Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) was officially inaugurated on March 1, 2016.    The $1 billion China Eximbank loan that supported Phase 2 was rescheduled on April 29, 2019. Under the terms of the debt rescheduling agreement, the Republic of Congo agreed to repay 33% of its its outstanding obligations for the Phase 2 (375 km Dolisie-Brazzaville Section) of National Route 1 (RN1) Construction Project within 3 years (more specifically, by December 31, 2021). For the remaining 67% of its outstanding obligations, the Republic of Congo agreed to a new repayment schedule that involved extending the maturity the loan by 15 years (from 20 years to 35 years) and resetting the interest rate of the loan from 0.25% to to 2%.  This debt rescheduling is captured in Project ID#58340.    Around the time of the rescheduling, the Republic of Congo was facing a balance of payment crisis and it decided to concession the RN1 through a toll-operate-transfer (TOT) privatization. The concession was won by La Congolaise des Routes S.A. (LCR), a joint venture between CSCEC (70% ownership stake), Egis Projects (15% ownership stake) and the Congolese Government (15% ownership stake). As of March 2019, LCR operated the RN1 through a 30-year franchise agreement. According to Li Jiqin, Chairman of CSCEC International, CSCEC reached out to the Republic of Congo for this deal because the NR1 was left unmaintained after its construction was completed in 2016.  Under this new agreement, CSCEC is responsible for maintaining the road while the French company, Egis, is responsible for managing toll collection. The CSCEC\\u2019s upfront equity investment in this public-private partnership (PPP) helped the Republic of Congo address its balance of payments crisis. The Republic of Congo also tried to convince the CSCEC to invest in a similar TOT privatization of National Route 2 (which was also constructed with financial support from China Eximbank), but the company declined as it believed the deal would not generate enough profit.\",\"On December 19, 2005, CMEC and the Government of the Republic of Congo signed a supplier\\u2019s credit agreement worth $551,507,000 (or approximately worth CFA 321.7 billion) for the Power Transmission Network Associated with the Imboulou Hydropower Plant Project. It carried the following terms: a 17-year maturity, 5-year grace period, a 0.2% interest rate, and a 0.25% default (penalty) interest rate. The borrower was originally expected to make 24 semi-annual repayments between 2011 and 2022. The proceeds of the supplier\\u2019s credit were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of its $648,832,000 commercial contract with CMEC. The Republic of Congo agreed to cover the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($97,325,000) itself.   Over the lifetime of the supplier\\u2019s credit, the Republic of Congo agreed to repay $557,849,330.50 in principal and interest. Then, on January 18, 2006, the supplier\\u2019s credit agreement was modified (in particular, Articles 6, 8 and 13). The project execution period was reduced from 5 years to 3.5 years and additional changes were introduced related to the name of the lender; the credit conditions; loan repayment and amortization table; the duration, validity and termination of the credit; and the conditions of entry into force of the credit.   Then, on April 13, 2018, CMEC and the Republic of Congo signed another supplier\\u2019s credit agreement modification to reschedule the repayment terms. The parties agreed that the outstanding balance of the loan ($348,614,050) would be repaid according to the following repayment terms: 22-year maturity, a 0.2% interest rate, and 14 semi-annual installments between June 2021 and December 2027. As such, the rescheduling agreement effectively increased the grace period of the supplier\\u2019s credit by an additional 3 years (from June 2018 to June 2021). As of April 13, 2018, the borrower had already repaid $207,876,503.54. The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $348,614,050 as of June 1, 2018.  Under the terms of the rescheduling agreement, the borrower was responsible for making a $25,249,617 repayment (24,901,003 in principal and $348,614 in interest) on June 1, 2021 and a $25,224,716 repayment  ($24,901,003 in principal and $323,713 in interest)on December 1, 2021. However, according to the Republic of Congo's Ministry of Finance, neither of these repayments were made. By the end of calendar year 2021, the Republic of Congo had approximately $50 million of principal and interest arrears to CMEC.  This project sought to build upon the CMEC-financed 120MW Imboulou Hydropower Plant Project (captured in Project ID#434). It involved connecting the Imboulou Hydropower Plant with several small power stations to construct a \\u201cmajor power channel\\u201d (or \\u201cenergy boulevard\\u201d) between the cities of Pointe-Noire, Brazzaville and Ouesso. More specifically, it supported the construction of a load dispatching center (\\u201credistribution center\\u201d); the construction and rehabilitation of 220kv transmission lines and very high voltage transformer plants between Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire (passing through Mindouli and Loudima); the construction of seven 220 KV and 110 KV high-voltage power stations in Djiri, Ngo, Gamboma, Oyo, Boundji, Owando and Djambala (including a 220kV Imboulou-Ngo segment, a 220kV Ngo-Brazzaville segment; a 220kV Ngo-Gamboma segment, a 220kV Oyo-Owando segment, and a 110kV Ngo-Djambala-Oyo-Boundji segment); the construction of underground 220kV transmission line in Tsi\\u00e9lampo; the construction of nine 30kV aerial lines measuring 242 km in length (including an Imboulou-Inoni-Mpoumako-Imvouba segment, an Inoni-Inoni2-Mbouamb\\u00e9-L\\u00e9fini segment, an Imboulou-Mb\\u00e9-Ngab\\u00e9 segment, and an Imboulou-Mpouya segment); the construction of four 20kV underground transmission lines of 20kV to evacuate power from the Imboulou Hydroelectric Power Plant to the capital city of Brazzaville; and the construction of nine additional 220 kV and 110 kV high voltage lines (measuring 841 km in length). In total, the project sought to create a 1,588 km national electricity transmission network.   CMEC was the contractor responsible for implementation. A project start order was issued on June 25, 2008. However, construction did not begin until May 28, 2009. The originally anticipated project completion date was December 31, 2011. But the project was ultimately completed on May 23, 2012.

(42) Total No.(104)] with the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka for the Phase II of Puttalam/Norochcholai Coal Power Project. The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee. The Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka then used the proceeds from the PBC (loan) to on-lend to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is a state-owned electricity company that controls all major functions of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing in Sri Lanka. CEB was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a commercial contract [ID# PCPP/CANC/2009/01] with China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation, which was signed on July 29, 2009.  China Eximbank disbursed an unknown amount in 2009, and unknown amount in 2010, an unknown amount in 2011, $127,781,680 in 2012, $110,377,930 in 2013, $50,765,212 in 2014, and $66,952,892 In 2015. The loan's amount outstanding was $772,200,000 as of December 31, 2016, $445,500,000 as of June 30, 2022.   The project involved the establishment of two power plants with a capacity of 300MW, a transmission line from Norochcholai to Anuradhapura, new substations at Chilaw and Anuradhapura and the construction of the expansion of coal handling port facilities and employees' housing.   China Machinery Engineering Corporation was the contractor responsible for project implementation and its work was overseen by the CEB. Phase I of the project, which was also financed by China Eximbank, ran from 2007 to 2011 (as captured via Project ID#33244 and #33463). The groundbreaking ceremony for Phase II of the project took place on March 18, 2010. Phase II was completed on September 16, 2014.   However, the project has encountered debt repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a \\u2018pre-emptive\\u2019 sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.\",\"In 2008, China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) established a joint venture with the Government of Niger called Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 de Raffinage de Zinder (SORAZ) to process oil from CNPC\\u2019s Agadem block in Niger (see Project ID#2137).  CNPC holds a 60% ownership stake, and the Government of Niger holds a 40% ownership take in SORAZ. To finance Phase 1 of the Agadem Oil Project, CNPC borrowed $880 million from China Eximbank in 2008 on the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a maturity of 11 years (estimated final maturity date: September 2, 2019), and a 1 year grace period. CNPC then used the proceeds of this loan to on-lend to Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 de Raffinage de Zinder (SORAZ).  The Government of Niger provided a sovereign guarantee for its 40 percent share of the SORAZ loan (equivalent to $352 million) on September 2, 2008. As of 2021, the loan had achieved a93.1% disbursement rate ($819,587,514 out of $880,000,000).  Phase 1 of this project involved the construction of the Soraz oil refinery in the village and rural commune of Ollelewa within Tanout Department and Zinder Region.  The refinery was designed to have a 20,000 barrel-per-day production capacity and to be fed entirely by oil from the newly-launched Agadem oilfield a further 700 km east.  The refinery draws crude from three Agadem wells with reserves totaling 480 million barrels.  Phase 1 of this project was implemented by CNPC and the refinery was officially inaugurated on November 28, 2011.  Also, in November 2011, the Nigerien Government commissioned the first of several audits of the upstream and downstream costs of the project. These audits, according to the IMF, revealed \\u201cinflated and undocumented costs\\u201d in the case of the oil fields, and \\u201creasonable costs but significant space to improve efficiency\\u201d for the SORAZ refinery.  The Nigerien authorities also kept the price of gasoline in Niger artificially low, which hurt the refinery\\u2019s bottom line.  An IMF report concluded that the \\u201caudit findings [were] critical to give leverage to the Nigerien authorities in the negotiations for the refinancing of the $880 million SORAZ loan, an essential step to ensuring the viability of the refinery.\\\"  There are multiple indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Agadem Oil Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. The Nigerien authorities announced in 2011 that China Eximbank had agreed to reschedule the loan for Phase 1 of the Agadem Oil Project by reducing the interest rate from 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points (approximately 6.56% in the year that the loan was contracted) to 6-month LIBOR plus 304 basis points.  Then, in July 2012, the Nigerien authorities announced that China Eximbank had again agreed to reschedule the loan by ensuring that \\u201cthe interest rate will not exceed 2 percent.\\\"  However, according to SAIS-CARI, despite this announcement and the leverage provided by the audit report, the refinancing plan still had to be approved in Beijing.  CNPC still needed to get the approval of China Eximbank, and this reportedly did not happen. Then, in February 2017, an IMF report noted that \\u201cnegotiations [for the refinancing] have stalled over the last two years\\u201d but that SORAZ now appeared able to service the debt \\u201cnormally\\u201d.  Of the $352 million share guaranteed by the Nigerien government, $161 million was still included in the debt stock as of 2018, one year before the loan was due to reach maturity.  One year later, in 2018, the China Eximbank reportedly agreed to reschedule the loan through a maturity extension from 2019 to 2021. Then, in 2021, the Government of Niger publicly acknowledged in its \\\"Rapport General Public 2021\\\" that SORAZ was facing the possibility of insolvency and bankruptcy and had fallen behind on repayments to China Eximbank. It also acknowledged that the new, final maturity date of the loan (after the rescheduling) was August 8, 2021.  The 2008 China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 is captured via Project ID#73319. The 2011 rescheduling of the loan that supported Phase 1 is captured via Project ID#58433.  \",\"In 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. On February 22, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $1 billion preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2010) 1 TOTAL NO. (109) and #CHINA2010-2-109] for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project (captured via Project ID#70728). The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, an interest rate of 2 percent, an 8 year grace period, a management fee of 0.2 percent, and a commitment fee of 0.2 percent. Additionally, on February 22, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan also signed an RMB 731 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2010) 10 TOTAL NO. (307)] for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project (captured via Project ID#36237). The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, an 8 year grace period, a 1% interest rate, a management fee of 0.2%, and a commitment fee of 0.2%.  Two months later, on April 9, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $474 million buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID#2010210195, ID#1260002052010210195, and #CHINA10-APR] for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project (captured via Project ID#70730). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 6 percent, a 20 year maturity, a 8 year grace period, a management fee of 0.75 percent, a commitment fee of 0.5 percent, and a Sinosure credit insurance fee of 7 percent.  The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a $2.37 billion commercial contract between Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute, which was signed on April 28, 2009.   As of June 20, 2017, $1.513 billion had been disbursed by China Eximbank for the Chashma Nuclear Power Project 3 and Chashma Nuclear Power Project across all three loan agreements (PBC, GCL, and BCL).   The purpose of the project was to construct Unit 3 and Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant (or CHASNUPP), which is a large commercial nuclear power plant located in the vicinities of Chashma colony and Kundian in Punjab in Pakistan (exact locational coordinates are 32.390278, 71.4625). More specifically, the purpose of the project was to (a) construct CHASNUPP-III, a 315-MW two-loop pressurized water reactor (PWR), using between 2.4\\u20143.0% low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel with a gross capacity of 340 MW; and (b) construct CHASNUPP-IV, another 315-MW two-loop pressurized reactor with a gross capacity of 340 MW.    China Zhongyuan Engineering, China Nuclear Industry No.5 Construction Company, and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering and Research Design Institute were the contractors responsible for Unit 3 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. China National Nuclear Cooperation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) supervised the work of all four Chinese contractors.  Construction of CHASNUPP-III (also known as C3 or Unit 3) commenced on May 28, 2011. CHASNUPP-III joined the nation's electricity grid system on October 15, 2016 and commenced its operations on December 6, 2016. It was officially inaugurated on December 28, 2016. Construction of CHASNUPP-IV (also known as C4 or Unit 4) started on December 18, 2011. CHASNUPP-IV was connected to nation's grid system on June 25, 2017 and it commenced its operations on September 19, 2017.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank preferential buyer's credit for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-034]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for the Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer's credit agreement for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, in April 2022, local media reported that the operation of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant and the repayment of the China Eximbank loans that supported its construction had become a challenge due the absence of requisite payments from the Government of Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency\\u2013Guaranteed (CPPA-G). The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2020-December 2020 is captured via Project ID#96254. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96246. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.\",\"On May 14, 2018, the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) \\u2014 a Pakistani government-owned power transmission company \\u2014 and Pak Matiari-Lahore Transmission Company (Private) Limited (PMLTC or Pak MLTC) signed an Implementation Agreement (IA) and a Transmission Services Agreement (TSA) for the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project. PMLTC is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture between China Chengxin International Ltd. (69.98% equity stake), China Excellence International Ltd. (30% equity stake), and the SPV\\u2019s directors (0.02% equity stake). It is responsible for constructing and operating an 878 km power transmission line from Matiari, Sindh (South of Pakistan) to Nankana Sahib, Lahore (North Punjab). The total cost of the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project, which is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative, was $1,658,340,000. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) \\u2014 on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (\\u2018BOOT\\u2019) basis \\u2014 and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The debt component is captured in Project ID#54013 and the equity component is captured in Project ID#53695.   On November 9, 2018, China Development Bank (CDB) Sichuan Branch signed a $1.326 billion overseas investment loan agreement with PMLTC for the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 10-year maturity length, a 2.25-year grace period (27 months), a 5.64% all-in interest rate (LIBOR plus 4.5% margin), a 1% upfront (management) fee, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Sinosure provided overseas investment insurance for this loan at a maximum rate of 0.60% per annum. The Government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and a 17% guaranteed return on equity (ROE) to the investors in the BOOT project. State Grid International Engineering Ltd. \\u2014 the overseas investment company of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) \\u2014 agreed to provide approximately $332 million in equity financing through two unspecified special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Financial close was achieved on February 27, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct an 878 km, 660 kV, High Voltage Direct Current Line (HVDC) that transmits 4,000MW of electricity (mainly from coal) from the Chinese bank-financed Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#53674), the Thar Block-2 Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#54314, #35127, and #54315) and the Chinese bank-financed Port Qasim Power Project (captured via Project ID#52904) to the northern parts of Pakistan (near Lahore). The starting point of the transmission line is at the Matiari Converter Station about 15 kilometers northeast of Matiari in Sindh Province, and the end point is at the Lahore Converter Station at a distance of about 40 kilometers southwest of Lahore in Punjab Province.  China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co. Ltd. (CET) \\u2014 a wholly owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) \\u2014 is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Under the terms of the BOOT contract, CET will operate the Matiari-Lahore transmission line for 25 years and transfer it afterwards to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), the Pakistani government-owned power transmission company. A project commencement ceremony took place on December 1, 2018. PMLTC also issued a notice to proceed (NTP) to CET for the commencement of EPC works on December 1, 2018. The project achieved mechanical completion in October 2020. It successfully completed equipment debugging, sub-system commissioning, and station commissioning with a certificate of readiness for interconnection and a certificate of readiness issued on December 1, 2020.   The project\\u2019s originally expected commercial operations date (COD) was March 1, 2021, but due to delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project ultimately reached its COD on September 1, 2021. The transmission line is currently operational. However, various problems arose during project implementation. On November 30, 2020, NTDC and PMLTC acknowledged that there was a defect in the transmission line, which emerged during low power testing. Additionally, the certificate of readiness issued on December 01, 2020, was later declared null and void upon the failure of the low power test due to frequency oscillation on December 2, 2020, and a notice of dispute in the matter was served to the PMLTC by NTDC. The matter was resolved between the parties through Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated February 18, 2021 without a declaration of the force majeure events and both parties agreed to extend the COD until September 1, 2021.   The project has also encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to PMLTC. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 14.5 billion (approximately $72.5 million). Then, in June 2022, the Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB) requested that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) make available foreign exchange so that PMLTC could make a $6.31 million Sinosure fee payment. In a letter to SBP\\u2019s Executive Director ofFinancial Market and Reserve Management (dated June 24, 2022), PMLTC noted a significant delay in approval by SBP of the $6.31 million payment request filed by the company on May 9, 2022. It also noted that late payment could result in a material breach of Sinosure policy leading to a contractual breach under financing documents. PPIB also noted that non-availability of requisite foreign currency could result in the lapse of consent under the Implementation Agreement (IA), which could in turn expose the Government of Pakistan to litigation. According to PPIB, pursuant to provisions of the IA, it is the responsibility of Government of Pakistan to make available through SBP the foreign currency not available through normal banking channels within the specified time for payment in foreign currency related to the projects, including the payment of premiums and fees to offshore insurers and reinsurers.   Then, in July 2022, Zhang Li (CEO of PMLTC) wrote a letter to the Managing Director of the PPIB, warning that the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s imposition of 17 percent general sales tax (GST) on transmission service charges (through amendments to the Finance Act, 2022 and Sales Tax Act, 1990) would have \\u2018severe financial implications\\u2019 for PMLTC. Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without \\u2018early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017\\u2019. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called \\u2018discos\\u2019). However, \\u2018due to various technical and financial constraints\\u2019, the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan\\u2019s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open \\u2018an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved\\u2019. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance\\u2019s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this \\u201c[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs\\u2019. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country\\u2019s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).\",\"On May 15, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $2,490,760,000 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project. The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 6-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The loan was also backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (SINOSURE). China Eximbank provided the loan in three separate loan tranches. The first tranche is worth $1,289,029,000 (captured via Project ID#70086) and it supported the Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project. The second tranche is worth $981,260,000 (captured via Project ID#70085) and it supported the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project.  The third tranche is worth $220,471,000 (captured via Project ID#70083) and it supported the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $1,289,029,000 China Eximbank loan tranche to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,841,470,000.00 commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), which was signed on October 25, 2011 (and modified on November 5, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 15, 2013) to support the construction of a 329 km Sebeta (Addis Ababa) to Miesso section of the railway. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $981,260,000 China Eximbank loan to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,401,800,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the ERC and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on December 16, 2011 (and modified on modified on November 2, 2012, February 7, 2013 and March 8, 2013) to support the construction of a 339 km section of the railway that runs from Miesso (Meiso) to Dewelle (Dewanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $220,471,000 China Eximbank loan to finance approximately 85% of a $259 million commercial contract between China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and the ERC, which was signed in March 2013 to support the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The purpose of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east \\u2014 via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso \\u2014 to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The purpose of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was to acquire 5 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives, 30 railway passenger cars and 1,100 railway freight cars for the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway.  * Loan Disbursements: According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $1,289,029,000 (ETB 24,004,264,432) loan tranche for the Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 14 loan disbursements (worth ETB 24,905,259,256) between 2014 and 2020: an ETB 1,062,992,126 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 5,420,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,303,030,303 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 5,597,115,886 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 1,808,159 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 1,740,583,177 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 825,731,677 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 2,165,153,034 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 143,690,666 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 923,238,863 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 325,274,645 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 372,159,087 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB  1,422,471,270 disbursement on September 20, 2017, and an ETB 2,602,010,364 disbursement on November 12, 2020. According to the Government of Ethiopia\\u2019s AMP, the $981,260,000 (ETB 18,272,998,138) loan tranche for the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 75% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth ETB 13,669,737,755 ) between 2014 and 2017: an ETB 5,580,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,585,858,586 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 1,515,331,236 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 243,681,645 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 1,660,143,553 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 1,092,814,700 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 448,108,619 disbursement on January 7, 2017, and an ETB 543,799,417 disbursement on July 7, 2017.

The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo\\u2013Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash\\u2013Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti\\u2013Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway\\u2019s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama\\u2013Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016).  The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015.  In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives \\u2014 that carry passengers and freight \\u2014  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and \\u4e2d\\u571f\\u96c6\\u56e2\\u4e0e\\u4e2d\\u94c1\\u4e8c\\u5c40\\u4e9a\\u5409\\u94c1\\u8def\\u8054\\u8425\\u4f53\\u516c\\u53f8) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Soci\\u00e9t\\u00e9 Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project\\u2019s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs as well as revenues are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa\\u2013Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country\\u2019s GDP) had been restructured\\u2014and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country\\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country\\u2019s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  \\u2018Overvoltage\\u2019 problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.\",\"In October 2002, a joint venture called CCMD Corporation, which is between China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE) and China Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Corporation (CWHEC or Sinohydro), applied to China Eximbank for a loan guarantee before bidding on the 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project in Sudan. On May 20, 2003, this Chinese consortium ended up winning three different contracts for this project:  (1) a $600 million (EUR 550 million) contract signed on June 7, 2003 for construction of the dam;  (2) a $60 million contract signed on December 23, 2003 for auxiliary projects related to the metal frame and hydraulic mechanics; and (3) a $400 million contract signed on December 23, 2003 for construction of substations and transmission lines. (Note: A $381.5 million loan for this project component is captured via Project ID#695).   On December 23, 2003, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed three different loan agreements worth a total of $519 million in order to partially finance the first two contracts:  (1) a $400 million loan; (2) a $65 million loan; and (3) a $54 million loan. These loans carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a grace period between 6 and 7 years, and interest rate of 3-4%. China Eximbank later increased its total lending for the 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project to $608 million (as captured via Project ID#178).   The total project cost is unclear but estimates range from $1 billion to $3 billion. Therefore, several other entities served as co-financiers. The 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project was co-financed with:  (1) $250 million from Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development (and possibly an additional $211 million) (2) $150 million from the Kuwait Development Fund (and possibly an additional $50 million) (3) $150 million from the Abu Dhabi Foundation (4) $200 million from the Saudi Fund for Development (5) $15 million from the Government of Qatar (6) $106 million from the Government of Oman  (7) $575 million from the Government of Sudan  The 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project involved the construction of a 9.7-kilometer-long and 65-meter-high dam with a total installed capacity of 1250 MW and a storage capacity at 12.4 billion cubic meters. It is located near Merowe Town in northern Sudan, about 350 kilometers (220 mi) north of the capital Khartoum. The project had 8 main components:  (1) Dam: This component included the construction of concrete and embankment sections of the dam on the Nile River channel. The dam crest was to be 9.7 km long and 10 m wide, and its height 60 m above river bed. The dam was also to include the appurtenant structures such as spillway, water intakes and sediment sluices, as well as a hydropower station.  (2) Preparatory Works: This component included the construction of housing facilities for construction supervision and operations personnel, the construction of 27 km access roads from Karima to the dam site, and a loading platform and storage areas at the nearby railway station. (3) Civil Works: This component included excavation, fill, drilling and grouting works, and concrete works for the dam and its appurtenant structures. It also included all civil works for the hydropower station, as well as all necessary instrumentation and monitoring equipment for the operation of the dam. (4) Mechanical Works: This component included the supply and installation of gates, pipes and related mechanical equipment for the dam and its appurtenant structures. (5) Hydro-Mechanical Works: This component included the supply and installation of gates, penstocks, cranes and related hydro-mechanical equipment necessary for the control of water, and operation and maintenance of the dam and its appurtenant structures. (6) Electromechanical and Electrical Works for the Power Station: This component included the furnishing and installation of ten turbines, each rated at 125 MW, and ten 150 MVA generators. It also included the construction of 500 and 220 kV switchyards, and the supply of the necessary transformers and bus bars, as well as control, protection and monitoring systems. (7) Transmission Lines: This component included the construction of 500 and 220 kV overhead lines having a total length of 1700 km, as well as seven sub-stations. (8) Consultancy Services: This component included the consultancy services required to review the conceptual design, prepare the detailed design, and construction supervision.  The project owner was Sudan\\u2019s Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources\\u2019 Merowe Dam Implementation Unit. The contractors responsible for implementation included China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), Sinohydro, Harbin Power Engineering Company (HPEC), and Alstom, a French company.   The originally anticipated project commencement and completion dates were July 30, 2005 and July 30, 2008, respectively. The project began construction on July 8, 2003, and the first two generators were officially connected to the national grid on March 3, 2009. However, it was not until April 8, 2010 that the tenth unit of the Merowe dam was officially connected to the grid. However; issues with silt and debris accumulation threaten the long-term life of the dam. By 2020, the dam had lost 1.7% of its holding capacity.  According to a 2015 book (entitled \\\"Water, Civilisation and Power in Sudan\\\") by Harry Verhoeven, Dr. Sabir Mohamed Hassan (the Governor of the Central Bank of Sudan) has \\\"described one of the reasons for prioritising Merowe as 'the government needed something big to show to the people'. It was no coincidence that Omar Al-Bashir campaigned for the Sudanese presidency in April 2010 with a picture of himself in front of the Merowe Dam, the symbol of civilisation delivered by Al-Ingaz, as his main electoral poster.\\\"  The project was awarded the Luban Prize, a master prize in the PRC for development projects. However, it was also plagued by controversy.  The project participants were required to prepare or contract an environmental impact assessment (EIA) in accordance with specific guidelines that address three major topics:  (1) Social issues -- consequences of people resettlement from future flooded area;  and (2) Archeological issues -- resulting from destruction or submerging important archeological sites or places of high cultural value; and (3) Environmental issues -- effect of large scale hydrological alteration of the natural river system with major impacts on the environment and water quality.   In April 2002, Lahmeyer International prepared the EIA report for the Merowe Dam Project. The report focused on complex resettlement issues involving about 7500 families. Among the environmental impacts it discussed were the hydrological changes, the erosion of the river bed and its banks, greenhouse gas emissions, and changes in the aquatic ecosystem. The 150 page report was far from meeting European or international standards, such as the guidelines of the World Commission on Dams. No serious attempt was made to use the vast scientific knowledge base on environmental effects of large dams, although four decades of research on the Aswan High Dam (Lake Nasser in Egypt, Lake Nubia in Sudan) had revealed a dramatic sediment accumulation in the upper part of the reservoir, problematic water quality issues and detrimental downstream effects such as river bed erosion or water level fluctuations. An estimated 60,000 civilians were ultimately displaced during the construction of the dam. Sudanese civilians protested the project\\u2019s execution from the start, and in a confrontation with authorities in April 2006, five people from a displaced community were killed.  There are also some indications that the loans that were issued for the construction of the Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. According to Sudan\\u2019s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022. \",\"On December 3, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Kenya (represented by the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya) signed a buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [Contract No. BLA201508] worth $1,397,927,373.27 for Phase 2A of the Standard Gauge Railway Project (also known as the Nairobi-Naivasha Standard Gauge Railway Project). The BCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20.5 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 0.5% ($6,989,636.87) management fee, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 1% default interest rate. It is scheduled for 30 semi-annual repayments between January 21, 2021 and July 21, 2036. The loan is backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The total cost of the Sinosure insurance premium is $161,875,409.70.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan (BCL) to finance (a) 85% ($1,260,333,275.02) of the total cost of a $1,482,745,029.40 commercial contract between Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on September 19, 2015; and (b) 85% of the total cost ($137,594,098.25 out of $161,875,409.70) of the medium-long term buyer\\u2019s credit insurance premium from Sinosure. The remaining 15% ($222,411,754.41) of the $1,482,745,029.40 commercial contract cost was to be paid by Kenya Railways Corporation to China Road and Bridge Corporation as counterpart financing. The National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya on-lent the proceeds of the BCL to the project\\u2019s \\u2018end-user\\u2019 (Kenya Railways Corporation).   The loan is also secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues from the Railway Development Fund (RDF), which are deposited in an escrow account.  According to the audited financial statements of Kenya Railways Corporation, the cash balances in the escrow account (Account No. 1203286473) were as follows: KES 239,914,450 (USD 2,327,170.16) in June 2017, KES 241,215,828 (USD 2,388,036.69) in June 2018, KES 2,816,826,324 (USD 27,604,897.97) in June 2019, and KES 2,853,104,749 (USD 26,819,184.64) in June 2020.  According to the Government of Kenya\\u2019s External Public Debt Register, a loan disbursement of $126,033,327.50 took place between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021). The borrower made principal repayments worth $46,101,100.98 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan\\u2019s amount outstanding was $1,256,999,701.81 as of June 30, 2020, $1,383,033,029.31 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,336,931,928.33 as of June 30, 2022.    The purpose of the railway extension project was to construct a 120 km railway \\u2014 including a 5.3 kilometer tunnel to be built in Great Rift Valley and a 6.5 viaduct across Nairobi National Park \\u2014 that would link special industrial zones in Naivasha (home to the Olkaria geothermal power plants) to Nairobi and Mombasa. The 120 km stretch of railway starts from the west end of the Nairobi South Hub (end point of the Mombasa \\u2013 Nairobi SGR); then it turns south-westwards through the Nairobi National Park and west past Twala and Ongata Rongai Towns; then it crosses Magadi Road next to the Adventists University and Ngong Road at Embulbul; then it descends into Rift Valley through a tunnel located North-West of Ngong Hills; then it proceeds North-West to the proposed Industrial Parks at Mai Mahiu and Suswa; then it crosses B3 at Duka Moja.    China Communications Construction Company and China Bridge and Road Corporation (CRBC) were the contractors responsible for project implementation. This project was formally launched by the President of Kenya on October 19, 2016 (through a foundation stone-laying ceremony). Construction was originally expected to be complete by June 2019. Construction ultimately commenced on January 12, 2018 and reached completion on September 19, 2019. The railway line from Nairobi to Naivasha was opened to traffic on October 16, 2019. However, this project encountered local resistance and provoked significant controversy. In April 2018, China Eximbank reportedly decided to withhold loan disbursements worth KES 32 billion due to a barrage of court cases against the project.\",\"On March 9, 2011, Reliance Communications entered into a $1.33 billion term loan facility agreement (\\\"Facility III\\\") with China Development Bank (CDB) to refinance a 3G spectrum fee payment and facilitate the acquisition of equipment imports from unspecified Chinese vendors. This loan carried an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.25% margin, but its maturity and grace period are unknown. It was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) (1) a first pari passu charge over the present and future moveable plant and machinery and capital work in progress of, and all rights, title, interest, benefits, claims and demands under and in respect of all insurance contracts entered into in relation to these assets by Reliance Communications Limited, Reliance Communications Infrastructure Limited, Reliance Infratel Limited and Reliance Telecom Limited; (2) assignment of 20 unified access service licenses, a national long-distance license and an international long-distance license of Reliance Communications Limited; and (3) pledge of: (i) 66,980,095 equity shares of Reliance Telecom Limited held by Reliance Communications Limited; (ii) 18,019,900 equity shares of Reliance Telecom Limited held by Reliance Infocomm Infrastructure Limited; and (iii) 9,379,999,994 equity shares of Reliance Communications Infrastructure Limited held by Reliance Communications Limited.  As of December 31, 2014, the (principal) amount outstanding under this facility was $1.237 billion. In February 2019, Reliance Communications filed for bankruptcy as it was unable to sell assets to repay its debts. \",\"On July 6, 2017, China Development Bank and the Electricity Supply Commission (Eskom) \\u2014 South Africa's state-owned electric power company \\u2014 signed a $1.5 billion (ZAR 20 billion) loan agreement. The loan is payable over a 15-year period and it has a five-year drawdown period. Its estimated interest rate is 3.7149%. The Government of South Africa issued a sovereign guarantee in support of loan. By the end of 2022, the loan\\u2019s estimated disbursement rate was 83.62%.   The purpose of the project was to construction Medupi Power Plant (Medupi \\u53d1\\u7535\\u5382\\u9879\\u76ee) in Lephalale, Limpopo Province. The plant consists of six units (boilers) with a total capacity of 4800 MW. The project also involved the construction of the Ngwedi substation. The project\\u2019s total estimated cost is $11.31 billion.   Hitachi, Alstrom, and WSP Global were the contractors responsible for project implementation and management. The first structural concrete was poured on July 18, 2008. The Ngwedi substation transformer was officially commissioned in December 2016.\\u00a0By July 2017, Unit 1 was at full production capacity and Unit 2 was close to full capacity. In June 2019, Eskom reported that Unit 3 had reached full load on May 16, 2018 (796MW) and was first synchronized to the national grid on April 8, 2018. Unit 3 followed Units 6, 5 and 4, which have been commercially contributing electricity to the national grid since August 23, 2015 (U6), April 3, 2017 (U5) and November 28, 2017 (U4). The power plant achieved commercial operation status on July 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the 4800MW Medupi Power Plant Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In February 2019, the CEO of Eskom was asked the following question by a reporter: 'Can you indicate and comment in general terms on the World Bank, DBSA, China Development Bank and other DFI loan covenants, and what may be considered a breach, such as failure to meet required going concern status, debt service coverage ratio and/or other metrics?' He responded that 'I am cautious not to breach the confidentiality of the lenders, but generally speaking, the going-concern status of Eskom is informed by normal credit metrics \\u2014 interest cover, debt service cover, and so on. When we do find ourselves in a situation where we will not meet these requirements, many of the terms do allow us to put forward an action plan on how it\\u2019s going to be resolved.' Then, in February 2023, South Africa\\u2019s National Treasury announced that it would would take on ZAR 254 billion ($14 billion) of Eskom's ZAR 423 billion debt that was at risk of default, to enable the state-owned power utility to pay down its principal and interest obligations.\",\"On June 28, 2012, China Eximbank and the Government of Ukraine\\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and Food signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding a $3 billion line of credit (captured in Project ID#42559). This agreement, which is popularly known as the loan-for-corn deal (or loan-for-grain deal), specified that China Eximbank would provide a $3 billion line of credit to PJSC 'State Food Grain Corporation of Ukraine' (SFGCU or PJSC DPZKU) \\u2014 a Ukrainian state-owned enterprise \\u2014 in two loan tranches: the first $1.5 billion tranche would be for the purchase of grain (through forward and spot contracts) and the export of grain to China, and the second $1.5 billion tranche would be for the acquisition of Chinese goods (plant protection products, machinery, elevator equipment) and potentially also the construction of biodiesel and corn processing production plants.   Then, on October 24, 2012, SFGCU and China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CCEC) signed a 'General Contract for Cooperation.' The contract specified that the $3 billion China Eximbank loan was to be repaid within 15 years with the proceeds from grain supply contracts between SFGCU and CCEC. Grain supply was to begin in 2012 (or 2013) and continue until 2027 (or 2028). The supply/sale of maize and other grains from SFGCU to CCEC was not to be less than 80 million metric ton over the 15-year period. SFGCU agreed to supply/sell 4 million tons in the first year, 4.5 million tons in the second year, and 5.2 million tons in the third year. Grain prices were tethered to futures contracts for the relevant period of time on the Dalian Commodity Exchange of China. The contract also stipulated that, in the event that SFGCU did not meet its annual grain supply commitments, CCEC had the right to notify China Eximbank so that it could in turn adjust loan disbursements in proportion to the annual supply of grain. SFGCU also granted CCEC the right to re-export grain to other countries for their legal resale. Additionally, under the terms of the contract, SFGCU agreed to buy various goods (including fuel, mineral fertilizers, plant protection products, seeds, agricultural machinery) and services from CCEC.  The contract further stipulated that CCEC would be the main EPC contractor for any turnkey project financed by the $3 billion loan agreement. The contract identified $1.5 billion worth of goods, services, and turnkey projects that CCEC would supply to SFGCU between 2013 and 2017: $275 million for the purchase of Chinese plant protection products; $305 million for the purchase of mineral fertilizers; $55 million for the purchase of agricultural machinery; $350 million for the purchase of seeds; $70 million for the construction of a plant for organic and mineral fertilizers; $70 million for the construction of a plant for the production of plant protection products; $195 million for the construction of an agricultural market center; $15 million for agricultural waste as alternative energy sources (pellets); and $165 million for the construction of a port elevator.  Then, on December 26, 2012, China Eximbank and SFGCU signed a $1.5 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement [\\u2116 BLA 201209], which represented the first tranche described in the June 28, 2012 MOU. This loan agreement is captured in Project ID#67803. It carried the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.515% in December 2012) plus a 4.5% margin, a maturity of 15 years, and a 5 year grace period. The final maturity date of the loan was December 28, 2027. The Government of Ukraine issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. In the event that SFGCU did not meet its repayment obligations, the guarantor (the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Ukraine) agreed to pay the amount of debt that was outstanding within 20 working days of receiving a written request from China Eximbank.   The full amount of the first tranche ($1.5 billion) was reportedly disbursed by China Eximbank and deposited in an account controlled by Ukraine Export-Import Bank (Ukreximbank) on February 6, 2013. The proceeds of the loan were reportedly used by the borrower (SFGCU) for forward grain purchases (i.e the purchase of barley, wheat, and corn from Ukrainian farmers intended for export to China). However, the SFGCU did not honor its commitment to sell 4-6 million tons of grain to CCEC each year. The SFGCU\\u2019s First Deputy Board Chairman Robert Brovdi said that his company had only exported 1.5 million tons of grain to China as of December 3, 2013. Other sources suggest that grain deliveries ranged between 10% and 23% of the agreed volumes. In March 2013, CCEC filed a complaint against SFGCU at the London Court of International Arbitration for failing to fulfill its grain supply obligations (and thus effectively defaulting on its repayment obligations under its $1.5 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan with China Eximbank). Shortly thereafter, the Ukrainian media reported that the loan had been defrauded, and Ukrainian officials had demanded large bribes in return for declaring to purchase agricultural machines in China.   On March 11, 2014, the Ukrainian Ministry of Agricultural Policy and Food relieved Ihor Yakubovych, the Chairman of the SFGCU, of his duties. Then, in April 2014, CCEC and SFGCU performed a comprehensive audit of SFGCU\\u2019s implementation of projects associated with the $1.5 billion dollar loan. Then, in early September 2014, the Prosecutor General's Office informed Ihor Yakubovych that he and his deputy were suspected of a crime: misuse of credit funds (from China Eximbank) and deliberately creating the conditions for embezzlement of $15 million in cooperation with other persons. Several months later, in January 2015, the Prosecutor General's Office put Ihor Yakubovych and his deputy on a \\u2018wanted list\\u2019 for allegedly fabricating official documents and embezzling funds. According to an investigation undertaken by the Prosecutor General's Office, Ihor Yakubovych and the SFGCU Director of the Department of Trading and Sales purchased grain for loans obtained under state guarantees through fictitious enterprises and sold the grain below market price to such companies as SN, Trans Trade RK SA, RL Prosperis Commerce SA, Trans Trade RK SA, Apiq Commodities Gmbh, Ai Amal General Traiding Limited, QAM7, and GSteam. In 2015, China Eximbank and SFGCU amended the $1.5 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan agreement in an unusual way. The amended agreement specified (in Annex 3) that, for every ton of grain exported by SFGCU to China, SFGCU would be obliged to pay China Eximbank a $5 \\u2018commission\\u2019 (above and beyond its principal and interest repayment obligations). Additional problems arose in 2017. On March 20, 2017, SFGCU was accused of attempting to illegally appropriate a privately-owned grain port terminal to increase its export capacity to China. Several media outlets also reported in 2017 that Ukreximbank froze SFGCU\\u2019s bank accounts at the request of China Eximbank.   Due to anticipated loan repayment difficulties, SFGCU and China Eximbank also engaged in debt rescheduling negotiations in March 2017. The parties ultimately agreed to reduce the loan\\u2019s interest rate from 6-month LIBOR + a 4.5% margin to 6-month LIBOR + a 3% margin. This loan rescheduling is captured via Project ID#85202.  Semi-annual principal repayments  commenced in January 2018 and the loan's principal amount outstanding stood at $1.2 billion in October 2019 and $900 million in October 2021.   Additional problems and controversies arose in 2019 and 2020. At the end of 2019, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) reported the detention of another former SFGCU chairman in Lithuania. Then, in early 2020, the Acting Chairman of the Board of SFGCU, Simon Chernyavsky, announced that law enforcement had opened 150 criminal cases against SFGCU officials. He also announced on March 2, 2020 that SFGCU was ordered by the London Court of International Arbitration to pay $4 million to CCEC. In August 2021, Ihor Yakubovych made an unsuccessful attempt to flee the country, but was detained by the National Police. In July 2022, China Eximbank was reportedly \\u2018playing hardball and threatening to send a default note on the loan\\u2019. This disclosure came at a time when the Government of Ukraine was seeking a 2-year moratorium on debt repayments to private and official creditors.  On January 23, 2020, SFGCU paid off $115.9 million on the loan issued by the Export-Import Bank of China: the corporation repaid $75 million of principal and $40.9 million of interest.\",\"On June 26, 2012, Kenya Railway Corporation (KRC) approved a feasibility study and preliminary project design from China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). Then, on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012, KRC and CRBC signed two commercial (EPC) contracts worth $3,804,192,784.92: (1) a $2,657,401,776.17 Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract on July 11, 2012 and (2) a $1,146,791,008.75 Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract on October 4, 2012. In August 2012, the Kenyan Cabinet approved the development of the railway, which was followed by the signing of a bilateral agreement by the Kenyan and Ugandan governments for the construction of the railway (that was later upgraded to a tripartite agreement with the Rwandan government). Less than a year later, in July 2013, the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya and China Eximbank signed an MOU \\u2014 that was witnessed by the President of the Republic of Kenya \\u2014 based on the commercial (EPC) contracts that CRBC and KRC signed on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. On May 11, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Kenya (represented by the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya) signed two loan agreements worth $3.604 billion for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project (also known as the Kenya Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project). The first loan was a buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) [Contract No. 1410302052014210766] worth $2,003,584,028.87 and it was provided on the following terms: a 5.25 year grace period, a 5 year (60 month) disbursement period, a 15.25 year maturity, an interest rate of 6-month Libor plus 3.6% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.75% commitment fee, a 0.75% ($15,026,880.22) management fee, a 6.93% insurance premium (payable in three installments), and a 1% default interest rate. The face value of the BCL was subsequently revised to $1,903,404,827.42. The BCL is backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The total cost of the Sinosure insurance premium is $211,543,142.85. The second loan was a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 13 TOTAL NO. (307) NO. (1420303052014210788)] worth $1,600,000,000 and it was provided on the following terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 7.25 year grace period, a 7 year (84 month) availability period, a 20.25 year maturity, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% ($4,000,000) management fee. The BCL was scheduled for 20 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2019 and July 21, 2029. The PBC was scheduled for 26 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2021 and July 21, 2034. The Government of Kenya on-lent the proceeds of the BCL (captured via captured via Project ID#37103) and the PBC (captured via Project ID#31777) to the \\u2018end-user\\u2019 (KRC). The ultimate borrower (KRC) was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL and PBC to to finance 90% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts that it signed with CRBC on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. More specifically, the proceeds from the PBC were to be used to finance 42.06% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts and be exclusively utilized to make payment for the \\u2018Line Section of the Project\\u2019 (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract). The proceeds from the BCL were to be used to finance (a) 31.95% of the total cost ($849,000,000 out of $2,657,401,776.17) of the \\u2018Line Section of the Project\\u2019 (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract), (b) 85% of the total cost ($974,772,357.44 out of $1,146,791,008.75) of the Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract, and (c) 85% of the total cost ($179,811,671,43 out of $211,543,142.85) of the medium-long term buyer\\u2019s credit insurance premium from Sinosure. The remaining 10% was to be paid by Kenya Railways Corporation to China Road and Bridge Corporation as counterpart financing, of which not less than $380,420,427.8 was to be applied to the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract. In order to facilitate repayment of its debts to China Eximbank, the Kenyan Government provided an assurance to the lender that it would guarantee a minimum amount of railway freight through the execution of a take-or-pay agreement between KRC and the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). The KPA also agreed to levy a new, 1.5% tax on imported goods (called the \\u2018Railway Development Levy\\u2019). The Railway Development Levy was designed to serve as insurance in case the revenues generated through the take-or-pay arrangement fall short of the amount required to service the China Eximbank loans. The borrower also expected to use to the Railway Development Levy to finance the Kenyan government\\u2019s portion (15%) of the project (commercial contract) cost.    The BCL and PBC are secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues that are deposited into a revenue account (escrow account) and a minimum cash balance in a payment account (escrow account). A 2014 Escrow Account Agreement between Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), the Government of Kenya, and China Eximbank specifies that \\u2018KRC shall ensure that the following minimum amounts in [U.S.] Dollars [USD] shall be held in the Payment Account, so long as an Secured Obligations under the Loan [PBC and BCL] Agreement remain outstanding: (i) when the Loans are within the applicable Grace Period, no less than US$84,000,000, which shall be deposited into the Payment Account in the following installments: 1) an amount, of US$16,800,000, shall be deposited into the Payment Account before the first disbursement, 2) an amount of US$16,800,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before January 15, 2015, 3) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2015, 4) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2016; (ii) when any Loan [PBC or BCL] is within its Repayment Period, no less than US$250,000,000, and (iii) when the [BCL is] fully repaid, no less than US$80,000,000.' If the borrower does not adhere to its loan repayment schedule (runs arrears), the escrow account bank is responsible for withdrawing funds the overdue payment amount (plus 1% penalty interest) from the payment account and remitting payment to China Eximbank; then, the escrow account bank reimburses/replenishes the payment account with funds from the revenue account (where project revenues are deposited).  According to the audited financial statements of KRC, the cash balances in the escrow accounts were as follows: KES 0 in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 1,000 (USD 11.4) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2014, KES 0 in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 1,000 (USD 11.4) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2015, KES 5,981,587,210 (USD 59,217,713.37)  in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 2,708 (USD 26.80) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2016, KES 8,713,702,264 (USD 85,394,282.18) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 72,472,503 (USD 702,983) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2017, KES 8,912,943,504 (USD 88,238,140.68) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 424,026,583 (USD 4,197,863.17) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 1,412,855,396 (USD 13,987,268.42) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2018, KES 9,078,451,382 (USD 88,968,823.54) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 5,334,370,360 (USD 52,276,829.52) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 1,567,057,226 (USD 15,357,160.81) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2019, and KES 9,195,200,216 (USD 86,434,882.03) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 18,447,296,513 (USD 173,404,587.22) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 2,991,272,808 (USD 28,117,964.39) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2020. Given that the BCL was still in its grace period until August 11, 2019 and the Preferential Buyer\\u2019s Credit (PBC) was still in its grace period until August 11, 2021, the borrower evidently complied with the lender\\u2019s requirement that it maintain a USD 84 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while the BCL and PBC were still in their grace periods and the lender\\u2019s requirement that it maintain a USD 250 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while either loan was in its repayment period (as specified in the Escrow Account Agreement).  The borrower made principal repayments on the BCL worth $100,179,201.44 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $200,358,402.88 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $1,903,404,827.42 as of June 30, 2020, $1,703,046,424.53 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,502,688,021.64 as of June 30, 2022.   The borrower made no principal repayments on the PBC between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and principal repayments worth $61,538,461.54 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The PBC\\u2019s amount outstanding was $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,538,461,538.46 as of June 30, 2022.  The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) is the largest infrastructure project constructed in Kenya since independence in 1963. The Kenyan Government and the Ugandan Government first promoted the idea of the SGR in 2008 as part of a Northern Corridor Initiative to link the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa to the landlocked countries of the Great Lakes Region. In August 2009, Kenya\\u2019s Ministry of Transport (MoT) and CRBC signed a memorandum of understanding, whereby CRBC agreed to undertake a feasibility study of the SGR Project at no cost to Kenya\\u2019s MoT.     In January 2011, CRBC submitted a feasibility report to Kenya\\u2019s MoT, which concluded that Phase 1 of the railway\\u2019s expected economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was of 14.66%, which was higher than the Government of Kenya\\u2019s \\u2018hurdle rate\\u2019 of 12%. However, the CRBC feasibility study later became a source of controversy. Its central conclusion \\u2014 that the SGR was economically feasible \\u2014 was inconsistent with the conclusions of previous studies undertaken by the World Bank and a Canadian consultancy firm. The CRBC feasibility study also included no cash flow projections. It asserted that the project would be highly profitable, but its estimates of the net present value (NPV) of the project\\u2019s expected economic benefits varied between $2 billion and $2.6 billion. The fact that the project\\u2019s estimated economic benefits were lower than its expected costs aroused suspicion about the credibility of the 14.66% EIRR estimate. The Government of Kenya\\u2019s decision to only allow CRBC to conduct the project\\u2019s feasibility study was also challenged by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), which argued that Kenyan laws require competitive bidding for a feasibility study. However, a Kenyan court ruled in favor of the government, and stated that the whole procurement process was legal. After the award of tender for the whole project was issued without competitive bidding, sub-tenders did not follow competitive bidding processes. Two Kenyan parliamentary committees, learning of this lack of competitive bidding, recommended cancellation of the sub-tenders, but they were ignored by President Kenyatta. Then, in 2020, a Kenyan court of appeal ruled that the SGR contract issued to CRBC was illegal because it was issued in a manner that is inconsistent Kenya\\u2019s procurement laws. The court ruled that the contract should be made public, but a Kenyan MoT official said that making the contract public would undermine national security.     The purpose of the project was to construct a 485 km railway from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to Nairobi and then onward to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan. Upon completion, the railway was expected have a total track length of 609 km. The project sought to transport passengers and cargo from Nairobi to the southeastern port city of Mombasa at 120 kilometers per hour, thus reducing travel time between Nairobi and Mombasa from more than 10 hours to more than 4 hours. The project was also expected to reduce travel times and transport costs by as much as 60 percent. If properly implemented, the Kenyan Government estimated that the railway would increase the country\\u2019s annual rate of economic growth by 1.5 percentage points.   China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation, and Kenya Railway Corporation (KR) supervised its work. Project implementation commenced on December 12, 2014. The project reached completion on May 31, 2017, eighteen months ahead of schedule. President Kenyatta scheduled the completion ceremony just two months before voters would go to the polls and on Madaraka Day\\u2014a national holiday that commemorates the day when colonial Britain granted Kenya the right to internal self-rule. At the project completion ceremony, President Kenyatta gave a speech and said that \\u2018[our] history \\u2026 was first started 122 years ago when the British, who had colonised this nation, kicked off the train to nowhere ... it was then dubbed the \\u2018Lunatic Express\\u2019. Today... despite again a lot of criticism we now celebrate not the \\u2018Lunatic Express\\u2019 but the Madaraka Express that will begin to reshape the story of Kenya for the next 100 years.\\u2019 However, the project has become a source of local scrutiny and controversy. In December 2018, a letter from Kenya\\u2019s Auditor General to the Kenya Ports Authority was leaked to the media. It suggested that the Port of Mombasa\\u2019s assets were sources of collateral that could be seized in the event that the Kenyan government could not repay its loans to China Eximbank. The letter also suggested that the Kenyan government had waived its sovereign immunity rights in order to make this pledge of collateral. The possibility that Beijing would seize a strategic asset like the Port of Mombasa provokes a public outcry in Kenya. President Kenyatta dismissed the criticism that the Kenyan government had mortgaged the Port of Mombasa to Beijing as \\u2018pure propaganda.\\u2019 He told a group of journalists that \\u2018if you want a copy of the [SGR loan] contract we have with China I can get it to you tomorrow. [\\u2026]\\u2019. But neither the BCL contract nor the PBC contract was made public. In 2018, the SGR project also became a target of an anti-corruption drive by Kenya's Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP). According to Reuters, the \\u201cKenyan authorities [\\u2026] arrested the head of the agency that manages public land and the boss of the state railway on suspicion of corruption over land allocation for the new $3-billion flagship Nairobi-Mombasa railway. [\\u2026] Mohammed Abdalla Swazuri, the chairman of National Land Commission, was one of 18 officials, businesspeople and companies named in a statement listing arrests that was posted \\u2026on the prosecutor\\u2019s office\\u2019s Twitter feed. Also arrested was Atanas Kariuki Maina, managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation. [\\u2026] The investigation that led to the arrests centers on allegations that officials siphoned taxpayer money through [fraudulent] compensation claims for land used for the railway.\\u2019    John Githongo, a former anti-corruption czar in Kenya, told a newspaper in August 2022 that \\u2018[t]he standard gauge railway is the jewel in the crown of corruption in Kenya.\\u2019 The secrecy surrounding the China Eximbank loan contracts that were issued for the SGR Project has also become a source of local concern. The Kenyan government has declined to make public the loan contracts in response to a court petition by two activists (Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo), saying they have non-disclosure clauses and that releasing them would amount to breaching a bilateral agreement, thereby impairing relations between the Kenyan government and the Chinese Government. According to an affidavit from Kenya\\u2019s Public Works Principal Secretary Solomon Kitungu, releasing the loan contracts would undermine Kenya\\u2019s national security \\u2018since [the] terms in the contract[s] touch on foreign government information with implications on national security and foreign relations.\\u2019 Two activists\\u2014Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo\\u2014filed a petition in 2021 at the High Court in Mombasa seeking to obtain all contracts, agreements, and studies for the construction and operation of the SGR. Through a coalition called Okoa Mombasa, Khalifa had previously attempted and failed to get the documents through Kenya\\u2019s Access to Information Act after the Kenyan government directed that all containerized cargo at the Port of Mombasa be transported inland through the SGR. This move reportedly had negative impact on the Kenyan coast\\u2019s port-based economy because it forced logistics companies to move their operations to container depots in the country\\u2019s interior. \\u2018We have a right to know the details of the project: how our money is being spent, the consequences of a loan default, and the government\\u2019s decision-making processes in signing the deal. Right now, we know none of this\\u2014the Kenyan public is completely in the dark,\\u2019 said Khalifa. Gikonyo, his co-petitioner, is the national coordinator for The Institute for Social Accountability, a Nairobi-based civil society organization.    Yet another concern about the project is related to its revenue performance. It was originally projected that the railway would move 22 million tons of cargo a year. However, a Government of Kenya assessment later revealed that the maximum amount of cargo that the railway could move was approximately 8.7 million tons of cargo a year. Also, one year after the SGR was put into operation, a parliamentary report showed that it cost more than double the amount to transport goods on the train than on the road. To make the railway profitable, the Kenyan authorities compelled importers to send cargo by railway instead of by road. This decision set off protests, riots, and court cases in October 2019 and November 2019. Then, on On December 4, 2019. Kenya\\u2019s senate committee on transport summoned the Kenyan cabinet secretary for transport over his directive to haul cargo from the port city of Mombasa to Nairobi exclusively by rail. The meeting \\u2014 attended by activists, businessmen and leaders from Mombasa \\u2014 ended with the cabinet secretary, James Macharia, promising to rescind the directive, which had reportedly hurt local businesses. Then, in September 2020  Kenyan lawmakers tabled a report in parliament recommending that the government renegotiate the terms of the China Eximbank loans for the SGR \\u2018due to the prevailing economic distress occasioned by the effects of Covid 19\\u2019. In the same report, the lawmakers recommend that the government renegotiate the SGR operation agreement, \\u2018by planning to reduce operation costs by at least 50%\\u2019. The SGR operators had to halt its passenger service for nearly three months due to concerns about the potential spread of the pandemic. CRBC operates the railway\\u2019s passenger and cargo service through its subsidiary, the Africa Star Railway Operation Company. In the three years the SGR has been in operation, Africa Star Railway Operation\\u2019s expenditure has always exceeded revenue, and the Kenyan taxpayer money has to fill the gap to sustain the company\\u2019s operations. A report by Kenya\\u2019s transport ministry tabled in parliament in 2018 says the railway made a loss of KES 9.8 billion ($90.3 million) in its first year of operation. At the time, the Kenyan Government projected a profit of $46.8 million for the following year. However, a report by the transport ministry in 2020, also tabled to parliament, said the railway recorded a loss of $200 million over the previous three years. The document also said that during this period, the railway generated revenues of $230.7 million but had operational costs of $430.5 million. The transport ministry cited reduced limited storage capacity at a Nairobi container depot, minimum use of the city\\u2019s freight terminal, and railway charges as reasons for this performance, arguably the kinds of details a thorough appraisal should have raised. The SGR operates both passenger and cargo services and while passengers embrace it for reducing travel time compared to buses, cargo owners shun it for reasons including higher fees and tariffs, additional time clearing goods and a lack of last-mile delivery, when compared to trucks. Kenya\\u2019s election in August 2022 became a vote on President Uhuru Kenyatta\\u2019s legacy of debt-financed infrastructure building, much of it built and financed by China Eximbank. This was especially true for the SGR.    The opposition party candidate Raila Odinga ran on a promise to renegotiate the Kenyan government\\u2019s outstanding debts to China Eximbank. Speaking at Chatham House in London on March 16, 2022, he said he would assemble a tough team of negotiators: \\u2018It depends on how you negotiate with the Chinese. If you don't have negotiators they will of course impose their terms on you.\\u2019 Several months later, in June 2022, the ruling party presidential candidate, William Ruto, told Reuters that he would publish government contracts with Chinese companies and renegotiate loans with China Eximbank. Then, in September 2022, newly elected Kenyan President William Ruto reverted cargo clearing services from Nairobi inland container depot (ICD) to the Port of Mombasa. The expected immediate impact of reverting port operations to the Port of Mombasa was a shift to road haulage and a reduction in cargo business for the SGR. Ruto\\u2019s predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, moved cargo clearance to the Nairobi ICD to help ease congestion at the Port of Mombasa and boost its competitiveness while also boosting traffic on the SGR to increase revenue for debt repayment. The effect of Ruto\\u2019s September 2022 decision was to shift more of the responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans to Kenyan taxpayers.  In mid-October 2022, Kenya\\u2019s incoming Transport Secretary, Kipchumba Murkomen also said during his confirmation hearing that he planned to renegotiate the China Eximbank loans for the Standard Gauge Railway Project. He said that these loans were likely repayable over fifty years rather than fifteen to twenty years. He also said that \\u2018[I]f approved, I will look for the SGR agreement and make it available to the public because no one knows the contents of that agreement\\u2019. Then, in November 2022, Kipchumba Murkomen publicly disclosed all three China Eximbank loan agreements for the SGR project.  There are some indications that the SGR loans have underperformed vis-a-vis the lender's original expectations. In July 2022, the Government of Kenya received 'settlement notes' (an overdue repayment notification) from China Eximbank. Then, in October 2022, local media outlets reported (based on confidential Treasury documents) that the Government of Kenya defaulted on its China Eximbank loans for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project. The lender reportedly imposed a fine (\\u2018default interest\\u2019 payment) worth $10.8 million (1.312 billion Kenyan shillings). \",\"On July 24, 2014, China Eximbank provided a letter of intent to Sinohydro Resources Ltd. to finance the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. Then, on October 16, 2015, China Eximbank and Port Qasim Electric Power Company (Pvt.) Limited (PQEPCPL) signed a $1,598,380,000 term facility (loan) agreement for the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project. The borrowing terms are as follows: 14-year maturity, 4-year grace rate, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.70% margin. The Government of Pakistan provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan and a 27.2% guaranteed return on equity to the project sponsors (investors). Sinosure also provided credit insurance for the loan. These insurance fees amounted to 4% of total debt service (principal and amortized interest). As of October 2018, China Eximbank has reportedly disbursed $975 million through the loan.   PQEPCPL is a project company (special purpose vehicle) that was established in 2014 for the sole purpose of designing, financing, insuring, building, establishing, owning, operating, maintaining, and managing the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project. The sponsors and shareholders of PQEPCPL are Sinohydro Resources Ltd. (51% ownership stake) and Al-Mirqab Capital (AMC) of Qatar (49% ownership stake). The total cost of this project was approximately $2.1 billion and it was financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 75:25. China Eximbank provided a $1,598,380,000 loan for the project, and the remainder was covered via $521 million of equity contributions from Sinohydro Resources Ltd. and AMC.   The Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project is located in the Port Qasim Industrial Park (exact locational coordinates: 24.7854\\u00b0N 67.3695\\u00b0E), and it consists of two modern supercritical coal-fired units, a self-dedicated coal unloading jetty and a 4 km-length channel dredged and transferred to Port Qasim Authority. The coal will be imported. The project, which is being implemented on build-own-operate (BOO) basis, is one of the largest \\u201cPriority Implementation Projects\\u201d under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The EPC contractors are Sinohydro Harbour Co., Ltd and CCCC Second Harbor Consultants Co., Ltd. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on April 20, 2015. Construction then began in May 2015. On November 29, 2017, Yao Jing, the Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, accompanied the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the power generation ceremony of the first unit of the coal power plant at Port Qasim. Then, on April 24, 2018, the project reached its commercial operations date (COD).   This project has been plagued by controversy. Transparency International Pakistan alleged that PQEPCPL and NEPRA colluded to set a tariff for the coal-fired power plant and artificially inflated the cost of the project. In August 2019, Prime Minister Imran Khan directed the formation of a committee to examine the causes of the \\u2018high cost of electricity\\u2019 and circular debt, and to propose a way forward to ensure \\u2018the future energy security of the country.\\u2019 The committee was given 12 weeks to complete the onerous set of tasks, which it concluded in April 2020 in the form of a 296-page report, titled \\u2018Report on the Power Sector: Committee for Power Sector Audit, Circular Debt Resolution & Future Roadmap\\u2019. The report claims that the cost of the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project was artificially inflated.   Then, in May 2022, it was revealed that PQEPCPL was having difficulty servicing its China Eximbank loan (including a $70 million principal payment due on May 31, 2022) due to the fact that the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to PQEPCPL. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 91.2 billion (approximately $483,360,000). PQEPCPL, in turn, had payment arrears to its coal supplier amounting to $140,000,000. As of May 2022, the coal supplier had stopped providing coal for the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Plant due to large outstanding payments. PQEPCPL warned that \\u2018without urgent payments to restore coal supply, the whole complex will shut down shortly\\u2019. Documents showed that the Port Qasim power plant also sustained losses of $153 million due to rupee devaluation. PQEPCPL official reportedly told the Pakistani authorities that \\u2018[s]ince 2014, billions of US dollars have been invested, thousands of people have worked hard for seven years but today the company has no cash, low coal inventory, huge outstanding payments, a huge exchange loss, making coal supplier and operation and maintenance contract bankrupt and facing loan default soon.\\u2019   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without \\u2018early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017\\u2019. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called \\u2018discos\\u2019). However, \\u2018due to various technical and financial constraints\\u2019, the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan\\u2019s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open \\u2018an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved\\u2019. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance\\u2019s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs\\u2019. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country\\u2019s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, on May 15, 2023, PQEPC served a formal notice of payment default on the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). The total overdue amount that CPPA owed to PQEPC at that time was $263.5 million. PQEPC's power purchase agreement states that a failure to pay an undisputed amount by the CPPA within 35 days of the notice constitutes a power purchaser event of default. PQEPC demanded that CPPA make a principal payment of $73.6 million before May 31, 2023 to avoid a 'facility agreement default' as well as a Government of Pakistan or 'GoP default'.\",\"The Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail (HSR) Project was originally going to be financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). In January 2014, JICA included the project in its Overseas Development Aid plan for Indonesia and agreed in principle to bankroll 75% of the total cost of the project at a 0.1% interest rate so long as the host government provided a loan repayment guarantee. However, Beijing was determined to win the contract for the HSR project and sought to outcompete Tokyo on several dimensions, including cost, speed of implementation, and level of public liability. In early 2015, Indonesian President Joko Jokowi invited China to submit an alternative proposal, and it proposed a lower cost version of the project that could be fully-financed with a government-guaranteed (CDB) loan at a 2% interest rate and implemented on a shorter timeline (3 years rather than 5 years).   Then, in September 2015, when President Jokowi was expected to announce the winning bidder, he surprised everyone by rejecting Beijing\\u2019s offer and Tokyo\\u2019s offer and \\u201ccancelling\\u201d the project. The stated rationale for his decision was that the project would lead to a ballooning of public debt. Tokyo responded by offering a 50% reduction in the amount of debt that would need to be backed by a sovereign guarantee. Beijing responded by scrapping the sovereign guarantee requirement altogether and proposing an off-public balance sheet transaction, in which CDB would work around the country\\u2019s public debt ceiling by extending a loan to a special purpose vehicle (jointly owned by Chinese and Indonesian state-owned companies) rather than the Government of Indonesia. Beijing\\u2019s revised offer was sufficiently attractive to seal the deal.   On October 16, 2015, a consortium of Indonesian state-owned companies (called PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN) and a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies (called Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd) established a joint venture and special purpose vehicle called PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (also known as PT Kereta Api Indonesia China or KCIC) to design, finance, implement, and manage the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project. PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN (PSBI) \\u2014 a joint venture of PT Wijaya Karya Tbk (38% ownership stake), PT Kereta Api Indonesia (25% ownership stake), PT Perkebunan Nusantara VIII (25% ownership stake), and PT Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk. (12%) ownership stake \\u2014 holds a 60% ownership stake (shareholding interest) in KCIC. Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd \\u2014 a joint venture of China Railway International Co. Ltd., China Railway Group Limited, Sinohydro Corporation Limited, CRRC Corporation Limited, and China Railway Signal and Communication Corp. \\u2014 holds the remaining 40% ownership stake (shareholding interest) in KCIC. Then, on May 14, 2017, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $3.9675 billion loan agreement with KCIC for the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail Project.   The loan consists of two tranches: a USD-denominated tranche worth $2.3805 billion (captured via Project ID#61320) and an RMB-denominated tranche worth $1.587 billion (captured via Project ID#61321). The USD-denominated tranche carries the following borrowing terms: 40-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and no sovereign guarantee. The RMB-denominated tranche carries the following borrowing terms: 40-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 3.46% interest rate, and no sovereign guarantee. ICBC is the security agent for the loan. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an EPC contract between KCIC and seven Indonesian and Chinese state-owned firms, which was signed on April 4, 2017. The total cost of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project is $5.29 billion and it is being financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. The equity contribution of Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd. is captured via Project ID#61322.   The purpose of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project is to construct a 142.3 km high-speed railway from the city of Jakarta to Bandung, the capital of West Java. Upon completion, the railway is expected to reduce the travel time between Jakarta and Bandung from more than 3 hours to less than 40 minutes. Construction began on January 21, 2016. However, the first CDB loan disbursement ($170 million) did not occur until May 2018. CDB planned to disburse another $1.1 billion before the end of July 2018. In May 2019, the 608-meter Walini tunnel was built. By September 2019, 32.8% of the project\\u2019s construction activities were complete and land acquisition progress reached 99%. By mid-February 2020, construction progress had reached 44% and land acquisition progress reached 99.96%. Then, in March 2020, the 442-meter No.5 tunnel was finished. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, work on the project was temporarily halted during the spring of 2020. Construction resumed in June 2020, and as of September 2020, the Director of KCIC Xin Xuezhong reported that construction progress had reached 60% and land acquisition progress had reached 100%.   The Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project, which was originally scheduled for completion in May 2019, has encountered a number of different problems during implementation. First, Indonesia Law No. 32/2009 regarding Environment Management and Control requires an environmental impact assessment (EIA) be developed over at least one year (and include analysis for both dry and rainy seasons) for a project of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR\\u2019s scale. However, the EIA for the project was completed in less than 6 months, and environmental NGOs claim that it contains inaccurate and flawed data analysis regarding the project\\u2019s actual environmental impacts. Second, the project reportedly violated Government Regulation No. 27/2012 regarding environmental permits, which requires public participation in the making of the EIA document. Environmental NGOs claim that, due to a lack of public participation in the EIA process, the project has serious design defects, including a planned route through numerous geological faults, which has led to delays, cost overruns, and local opposition. Third, although KCIC exclusively appointed PT Pilar Sinergi, a state-owned enterprise to deal with land acquisition issues, the process has not proceeded as smoothly as the Indonesian government had hoped. In July 2018, three lawsuits resulted in legal approval from the courts to proceed with claims seeking compensation for their properties affected by the project. Fourth, Indonesia\\u2019s Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR) ordered a temporary halt to the project on March 2, 2020 after flooding blocked the main toll road between Jakarta and the city of Cikampe. Acting Director General of Public Works Danis Sumadilaga said piles of soil dumped on roadsides had buried drainage channels and caused the flooding, adding that shoddy management practices paid scant attention to health, safety, and environmental degradation concerns. Fifth, during the construction process, gas pipelines owned by the national Pertamina Oil Company were damaged, which caused an explosion and killed a Chinese worker in Melong, near Cimahi town. Sixth, blasting work for tunnels in the area of the Tipar Sari Asih housing complex in the West Java town of Cimahi has caused serious damage. According to Meiki Paendong, executive director of WALHI West Java, an environmental NGO based in Bandung, \\u201c[m]any walls of [nearby] houses cracked \\u2026 [and] there was information that [the company] would examine the impact, but until now, the results of the inspection have not been made public.\\u201d Seventh, when flooding hit the Jakarta suburb of Bekasi in January 2020, Deputy Mayor Tri Ardhianto Tjahyono pointed to the HSR project as a cause, as did officials in the West Bandung regency which also flooded. Arief Maulana, head of Bekasi City Public Works and Water Management, said that \\u201c[o]ne of KCIC effects\\u2026 is the problem of drainage control in several project activity locations, which are close to the drainage area that causes sedimentation and also disrupted waterways.\\u201d Maulana argued that it is the responsibility of KCIC to fix all drainage damage due to the project. KCIC eventually agreed to repair and restore the drainage system after the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry demanded an assessment of the project in March 2020, due to environmental degradation concerns. Meiki Paendong, executive director of WALHI West Java, argues that the flooding in Bekasi and elsewhere demonstrated that the project\\u2019s EIA was flawed, as it failed to address the closure and loss of drainage flows due to land-use change. For example, drainage canals were covered by landfills, which reportedly increased flooding throughout the rainy season.   In 2015, Indonesian President Joko Jokowi signed a decree prohibiting the use of government funds for the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project. However, during implementation, the project encountered major cost overruns worth an estimated $2 billion due to various factors, including but not limited to higher-than-expected land procurement costs, delays in construction due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the rising prices of materials, and additional project insurance costs and debt service reserve account (DSRA) requirements. Then, in October 2021, President Jokowi reversed course, issuing a new decree and authorizing a government bailout of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project. The Indonesian government reportedly authorized the use of $286.7 million from state coffers to inject liquidity into PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (the borrowing institution) in the next fiscal year. It also made clear that it was prepared to provide additional funding on an as needed basis. At the time, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), said that \\u2018like it or not, \\u2026 we have to ask the government to participate in funding the project if we want it to be finished on time.\\u2019 Then, in July 2022, the project\\u2019s prime contractor (PT KCIC) reported that the project had achieved an 85% completion rate. At that time, Jakarta-Bandung HSR saw the laying of ballasted tracks begin on its main line. One month later, in August 2022, high-speed bullet trains for the Indonesian Jakarta-Bandung HSR rolled off the assembly line in Qingdao within China\\u2019s Shandong Province. Eleven pairs of high-speed electric multiple units (EMUs) and one set of comprehensive testing bullet railcars were ready to be shipped to Indonesia.   As of August 2022, all Jakarta-Bandung HSR tunnels had been completed and more than 90 percent of the subgrade, bridge and station civil works had been completed. By October 2022, the project had achieved a 88.8% completion rate. Also, during the last quarter of calendar year 2022, Indonesian state auditor BPKP reported that the cost overruns associated with the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project were just under $1.5 billion (rather than the earlier estimate of $2 billion). On October 18, 2022, Indonesia\\u2019s Deputy Minister of SOEs Kartiko Wirjoatmodjo announced that \\u2018[w]e are currently in the final negotiation with CDB for additional loans for cost overruns'. He also indicated that KCIC would contract one or more supplementary loans worth $1.03 billion (IDR 16.1 trillion) from CDB to cover approximately 75% of the project\\u2019s cost overruns (worth $1.45 billion). Then, on November 9, 2022, KCIC Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi told a legislative committee that the project\\u2019s cash flow would run out by the end of the month and China\\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) agreed that 75% of the project\\u2019s cost overruns should be funded with the proceeds of an additional CDB loan. At the time, KCIC was also asking parliament to make another IDR 3.22 million cash injection into the project company (as an additional equity contribution on behalf of PSBI) in conjunction with an additional IDR 2.15 trillion equity contribution from Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd. KCIC Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi told the legislative committee that completing the project by June 2023 would require receipt of additional project debt and equity by the end of November 2022.   On March 31, 2023, the track laying of the whole line of the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway was completed. Then, on April 10, 2023, Indonesia' Chief Investment Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said that KCIC had been working with CDB to lower the interest rate attached to the supplementary loan to cover the project's cost overruns. The Indonesian Government proposed a $560 million loan at a 2%interest rate from China Development Bank (CDB) to pay for the cost overruns. In April 2023, Luhut told a press briefing in Jakarta that '[CDB] is already willing to bring the interest down from 4 percent. The first offer is a reduction from 4 percent to 3.4 percent, but we want it to be even lower. [...] We do want a 2 percent interest, but it is impossible to have everything [we want] come true. If you ask for loans [outside China], the interest can go up to 6 percent. So if we end up with a 3.4-percent rate, we are doing okay, although not that okay. But that would be better than [borrowing money from other countries].' Luhut also noted that a 3.4 percent interest rate would not necessarily be problematic: 'Do not underestimate our country. We are getting better. Our state tax revenue has grown by 48.6 percent [in January 2023] thanks to better efficiency with digitalization, etc.'  As of April 2023, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway was expected to launch its commercial operations on August 18, 2023 \\u2014 one day after the 78th anniversary of Indonesia's independence day.  Then, in May 2023, Indonesia\\u2019s Transport Ministry and three consulting firms -- Mott MacDonald, PwC and local law firm Umbra -- pushed back on the suggestion that the project could achieve full-fledged commercial operations by August 18, 2023. At the time, the Chinese participants in KCIC reportedly wanted a full operational worthiness certificate for the Jakarta-Bandung HSC despite the incomplete construction of a railway station, but the Indonesian Transport Ministry and its consultants suggested that KCIC might not achieve full-fledged commercial operations until December 31, 2023.   Then, in June 2023, Reuters reported that KCIC was still in negotiations with CDB over a $560 million supplemental loan (captured via captured via Project ID#96344). After CDB offered an interest rate of 3.46% on the loan's RMB-denominated tranche, KCIC reportedly countered with a 2.8% interest rate request.\",\"On July 14, 2010, China Development Bank (CDB), Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), and Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) signed a loan agreement for Phase 2 of the Myingyan No. 1 Steel Mill Construction Project. The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 4.5% interest rate. Then, on June 14, 2011, China Development Bank, Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), and Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) signed a loan agreement for Phase 2A and 3 of the Myingyan No. 1 Steel Mill Construction Project. The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: a 21 year maturity, a 6 year grace period, and a 5% interest rate.   The precise face values of the 2010 and 2011 loans are unknown. However, according to a Government of Myanmar General Statistical Report and a Mandalay Regional Auditor General's Report (covering the period April 2018 to September 2018), total CDB disbursements for the project amounted to EUR 1,042,340,000 (EUR 566.97 million euros when the steel mill was under MEC ownership and EUR 475.37 million during the period when Myanmar\\u2019s Ministry of Industry was responsible for the steel mill).   The CDB loan repayment period for Phase 2 of the project runs from FY2015-16 to 2030-31. The CDB loan repayment period for Phase 2A and Phase 3 of the project is FY2017-18 to 2032-33. The total principal and interest outstanding under the two CDB loans was EUR 1.615 billion as of 2020.  The purpose of the project was to construct a steel mill \\u2014 with the capacity to produce 400,000 tons per year of steel, steel products, construction materials, and machinery materials \\u2014 near Sar Khar Village within Myingyan Township and the Mandalay Region (approximately 3.3 miles west of milepost 450/0 on the Yangon Myingyan Highway).   The project was implemented in three phases. Phase 1 commenced operations in March 2010 and it reportedly reached completion. However, it does not appear that Phase 2 or 3 (which were designed to produce value added products) ever reached completion. Responsibility for the steel mill was transferred from MEC to Myanmar\\u2019s Minstry of Industry on October 1, 2012.   There are some indications that the CDB loans for Myingyan No. 1 Steel Mill Construction Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. The mill was shuttered on February 17, 2017 because it was consistently losing money. Then, in 2020, the Acting Mandalay Chief Minister stated that the total project debt including interest exceeded EUR 1.615 billion. Consequently, the Government of Myanmar found itself in the position of having to pay 500 million kyats ($345,000) a day to CDB to service a loan contracted by a military-backed conglomerate (MEC) for a steel mill that was no longer operational. In 2020, CDB and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 5 loan agreements (as captured via Project ID#98030).  Debt service payments under these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#98031).  On August 16, 2021, the military junta-appointed Minister of Industry, Dr. Charlie Than, visited the project site and announced that work at the steel mill would commence 'as soon as possible' (at the instruction of coup leader Min Aung Hlaing). A Yangon-based observer monitoring investment projects in the country noted at the time that the military regime was rapidly resuming Chinese-financed projects -- paused by the [National League for Democracy (NLD) government] -- to prove that it could make the initiatives profitable: 'They are doing that intentionally and for political purposes. They want to say that they are able to do it even though the previous civilian government suspended it,' the observer said. \",\"In 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed a $1,098,132,680 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Khartoum-Port Sudan Railway Construction Project. The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 19.5-year repayment period, a 4% interest rate, and an unknown grace period.   The proceeds of the BCL were used to partially finance the $1.154 billion commercial contract signed on February 28, 2007 with China Railway Engineering Group Co. Ltd. and China Railway Erju Co. Ltd. Unit Transtech Engineering Corporation.  The project involved constructing a 762 km railway line from Port Sudan to Khartoum via Atbara. It also involved the provision of electric multiple units (EMUs) from CSR Ziyang Locomotive Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Electric Company.   A groundbreaking ceremony for the Atbara to Port Sudan portion of the railway was held on February 20, 2013, and a formal project handover ceremony for the Khartoum to Atbara portion of the railway was held on January 20, 2014.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the Khartoum-Port Sudan Railway Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. In August 2010, the Economic and Commercial Counsellor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in Sudan reported that the project had been stagnant due to the Government of Sudan's inability to make loan repayments. Then, according to Sudan\\u2019s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022.\",\"On June 26, 2012, Kenya Railway Corporation (KRC) approved a feasibility study and preliminary project design from China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). Then, on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012, KRC and CRBC signed two commercial (EPC) contracts worth $3,804,192,784.92: (1) a $2,657,401,776.17 Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract on July 11, 2012 and (2) a $1,146,791,008.75 Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract on October 4, 2012. In August 2012, the Kenyan Cabinet approved the development of the railway, which was followed by the signing of a bilateral agreement by the Kenyan and Ugandan governments for the construction of the railway (that was later upgraded to a tripartite agreement with the Rwandan government). Less than a year later, in July 2013, the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya and China Eximbank signed an MOU \\u2014 that was witnessed by the President of the Republic of Kenya \\u2014 based on the commercial (EPC) contracts that CRBC and KRC signed on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. On May 11, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Kenya (represented by the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya) signed two loan agreements worth $3.604 billion for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project (also known as the Kenya Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project). The first loan was a buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) [Contract No. 1410302052014210766] worth $2,003,584,028.87 and it was provided on the following terms: a 5.25 year grace period, a 5 year (60 month) disbursement period, a 15.25 year maturity, an interest rate of 6-month Libor plus 3.6% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.75% commitment fee, a 0.75% ($15,026,880.22) management fee, a 6.93% insurance premium (payable in three installments), and a 1% default interest rate. The face value of the BCL was subsequently revised to $1,903,404,827.42. The BCL is backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The total cost of the Sinosure insurance premium is $211,543,142.85. The second loan was a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 13 TOTAL NO. (307) NO. (1420303052014210788)] worth $1,600,000,000 and it was provided on the following terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 7.25 year grace period, a 7 year (84 month) availability period, a 20.25 year maturity, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% ($4,000,000) management fee. The BCL was scheduled for 20 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2019 and July 21, 2029. The PBC was scheduled for 26 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2021 and July 21, 2034. The Government of Kenya on-lent the proceeds of the BCL (captured via captured via Project ID#37103) and the PBC (captured via Project ID#31777) to the \\u2018end-user\\u2019 (KRC). The ultimate borrower (KRC) was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL and PBC to to finance 90% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts that it signed with CRBC on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. More specifically, the proceeds from the PBC were to be used to finance 42.06% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts and be exclusively utilized to make payment for the \\u2018Line Section of the Project\\u2019 (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract). The proceeds from the BCL were to be used to finance (a) 31.95% of the total cost ($849,000,000 out of $2,657,401,776.17) of the \\u2018Line Section of the Project\\u2019 (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract), (b) 85% of the total cost ($974,772,357.44 out of $1,146,791,008.75) of the Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract, and (c) 85% of the total cost ($179,811,671,43 out of $211,543,142.85) of the medium-long term buyer\\u2019s credit insurance premium from Sinosure. The remaining 10% was to be paid by Kenya Railways Corporation to China Road and Bridge Corporation as counterpart financing, of which not less than $380,420,427.8 was to be applied to the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract. In order to facilitate repayment of its debts to China Eximbank, the Kenyan Government provided an assurance to the lender that it would guarantee a minimum amount of railway freight through the execution of a take-or-pay agreement between KRC and the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). The KPA also agreed to levy a new, 1.5% tax on imported goods (called the \\u2018Railway Development Levy\\u2019). The Railway Development Levy was designed to serve as insurance in case the revenues generated through the take-or-pay arrangement fall short of the amount required to service the China Eximbank loans. The borrower also expected to use to the Railway Development Levy to finance the Kenyan government\\u2019s portion (15%) of the project (commercial contract) cost.    The BCL and PBC are secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues that are deposited into a revenue account (escrow account) and a minimum cash balance in a payment account (escrow account). A 2014 Escrow Account Agreement between Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), the Government of Kenya, and China Eximbank specifies that \\u2018KRC shall ensure that the following minimum amounts in [U.S.] Dollars [USD] shall be held in the Payment Account, so long as an Secured Obligations under the Loan [PBC and BCL] Agreement remain outstanding: (i) when the Loans are within the applicable Grace Period, no less than US$84,000,000, which shall be deposited into the Payment Account in the following installments: 1) an amount, of US$16,800,000, shall be deposited into the Payment Account before the first disbursement, 2) an amount of US$16,800,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before January 15, 2015, 3) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2015, 4) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2016; (ii) when any Loan [PBC or BCL] is within its Repayment Period, no less than US$250,000,000, and (iii) when the [BCL is] fully repaid, no less than US$80,000,000.' If the borrower does not adhere to its loan repayment schedule (runs arrears), the escrow account bank is responsible for withdrawing funds the overdue payment amount (plus 1% penalty interest) from the payment account and remitting payment to China Eximbank; then, the escrow account bank reimburses/replenishes the payment account with funds from the revenue account (where project revenues are deposited).  According to the audited financial statements of KRC, the cash balances in the escrow accounts were as follows: KES 0 in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 1,000 (USD 11.4) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2014, KES 0 in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 1,000 (USD 11.4) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2015, KES 5,981,587,210 (USD 59,217,713.37)  in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 2,708 (USD 26.80) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2016, KES 8,713,702,264 (USD 85,394,282.18) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 72,472,503 (USD 702,983) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2017, KES 8,912,943,504 (USD 88,238,140.68) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 424,026,583 (USD 4,197,863.17) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 1,412,855,396 (USD 13,987,268.42) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2018, KES 9,078,451,382 (USD 88,968,823.54) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 5,334,370,360 (USD 52,276,829.52) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 1,567,057,226 (USD 15,357,160.81) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2019, and KES 9,195,200,216 (USD 86,434,882.03) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 18,447,296,513 (USD 173,404,587.22) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 2,991,272,808 (USD 28,117,964.39) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2020. Given that the BCL was still in its grace period until August 11, 2019 and the Preferential Buyer\\u2019s Credit (PBC) was still in its grace period until August 11, 2021, the borrower evidently complied with the lender\\u2019s requirement that it maintain a USD 84 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while the BCL and PBC were still in their grace periods and the lender\\u2019s requirement that it maintain a USD 250 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while either loan was in its repayment period (as specified in the Escrow Account Agreement).  The borrower made principal repayments on the BCL worth $100,179,201.44 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $200,358,402.88 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The BCL\\u2019s amount outstanding was $1,903,404,827.42 as of June 30, 2020, $1,703,046,424.53 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,502,688,021.64 as of June 30, 2022.   The borrower made no principal repayments on the PBC between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and principal repayments worth $61,538,461.54 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The PBC\\u2019s amount outstanding was $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,538,461,538.46 as of June 30, 2022.  The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) is the largest infrastructure project constructed in Kenya since independence in 1963. The Kenyan Government and the Ugandan Government first promoted the idea of the SGR in 2008 as part of a Northern Corridor Initiative to link the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa to the landlocked countries of the Great Lakes Region. In August 2009, Kenya\\u2019s Ministry of Transport (MoT) and CRBC signed a memorandum of understanding, whereby CRBC agreed to undertake a feasibility study of the SGR Project at no cost to Kenya\\u2019s MoT.     In January 2011, CRBC submitted a feasibility report to Kenya\\u2019s MoT, which concluded that Phase 1 of the railway\\u2019s expected economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was of 14.66%, which was higher than the Government of Kenya\\u2019s \\u2018hurdle rate\\u2019 of 12%. However, the CRBC feasibility study later became a source of controversy. Its central conclusion \\u2014 that the SGR was economically feasible \\u2014 was inconsistent with the conclusions of previous studies undertaken by the World Bank and a Canadian consultancy firm. The CRBC feasibility study also included no cash flow projections. It asserted that the project would be highly profitable, but its estimates of the net present value (NPV) of the project\\u2019s expected economic benefits varied between $2 billion and $2.6 billion. The fact that the project\\u2019s estimated economic benefits were lower than its expected costs aroused suspicion about the credibility of the 14.66% EIRR estimate. The Government of Kenya\\u2019s decision to only allow CRBC to conduct the project\\u2019s feasibility study was also challenged by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), which argued that Kenyan laws require competitive bidding for a feasibility study. However, a Kenyan court ruled in favor of the government, and stated that the whole procurement process was legal. After the award of tender for the whole project was issued without competitive bidding, sub-tenders did not follow competitive bidding processes. Two Kenyan parliamentary committees, learning of this lack of competitive bidding, recommended cancellation of the sub-tenders, but they were ignored by President Kenyatta. Then, in 2020, a Kenyan court of appeal ruled that the SGR contract issued to CRBC was illegal because it was issued in a manner that is inconsistent Kenya\\u2019s procurement laws. The court ruled that the contract should be made public, but a Kenyan MoT official said that making the contract public would undermine national security.     The purpose of the project was to construct a 485 km railway from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to Nairobi and then onward to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan. Upon completion, the railway was expected have a total track length of 609 km. The project sought to transport passengers and cargo from Nairobi to the southeastern port city of Mombasa at 120 kilometers per hour, thus reducing travel time between Nairobi and Mombasa from more than 10 hours to more than 4 hours. The project was also expected to reduce travel times and transport costs by as much as 60 percent. If properly implemented, the Kenyan Government estimated that the railway would increase the country\\u2019s annual rate of economic growth by 1.5 percentage points.   China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation, and Kenya Railway Corporation (KR) supervised its work. Project implementation commenced on December 12, 2014. The project reached completion on May 31, 2017, eighteen months ahead of schedule. President Kenyatta scheduled the completion ceremony just two months before voters would go to the polls and on Madaraka Day\\u2014a national holiday that commemorates the day when colonial Britain granted Kenya the right to internal self-rule. At the project completion ceremony, President Kenyatta gave a speech and said that \\u2018[our] history \\u2026 was first started 122 years ago when the British, who had colonised this nation, kicked off the train to nowhere ... it was then dubbed the \\u2018Lunatic Express\\u2019. Today... despite again a lot of criticism we now celebrate not the \\u2018Lunatic Express\\u2019 but the Madaraka Express that will begin to reshape the story of Kenya for the next 100 years.\\u2019 However, the project has become a source of local scrutiny and controversy. In December 2018, a letter from Kenya\\u2019s Auditor General to the Kenya Ports Authority was leaked to the media. It suggested that the Port of Mombasa\\u2019s assets were sources of collateral that could be seized in the event that the Kenyan government could not repay its loans to China Eximbank. The letter also suggested that the Kenyan government had waived its sovereign immunity rights in order to make this pledge of collateral. The possibility that Beijing would seize a strategic asset like the Port of Mombasa provokes a public outcry in Kenya. President Kenyatta dismissed the criticism that the Kenyan government had mortgaged the Port of Mombasa to Beijing as \\u2018pure propaganda.\\u2019 He told a group of journalists that \\u2018if you want a copy of the [SGR loan] contract we have with China I can get it to you tomorrow. [\\u2026]\\u2019. But neither the BCL contract nor the PBC contract was made public. In 2018, the SGR project also became a target of an anti-corruption drive by Kenya's Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP). According to Reuters, the \\u201cKenyan authorities [\\u2026] arrested the head of the agency that manages public land and the boss of the state railway on suspicion of corruption over land allocation for the new $3-billion flagship Nairobi-Mombasa railway. [\\u2026] Mohammed Abdalla Swazuri, the chairman of National Land Commission, was one of 18 officials, businesspeople and companies named in a statement listing arrests that was posted \\u2026on the prosecutor\\u2019s office\\u2019s Twitter feed. Also arrested was Atanas Kariuki Maina, managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation. [\\u2026] The investigation that led to the arrests centers on allegations that officials siphoned taxpayer money through [fraudulent] compensation claims for land used for the railway.\\u2019    John Githongo, a former anti-corruption czar in Kenya, told a newspaper in August 2022 that \\u2018[t]he standard gauge railway is the jewel in the crown of corruption in Kenya.\\u2019 The secrecy surrounding the China Eximbank loan contracts that were issued for the SGR Project has also become a source of local concern. The Kenyan government has declined to make public the loan contracts in response to a court petition by two activists (Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo), saying they have non-disclosure clauses and that releasing them would amount to breaching a bilateral agreement, thereby impairing relations between the Kenyan government and the Chinese Government. According to an affidavit from Kenya\\u2019s Public Works Principal Secretary Solomon Kitungu, releasing the loan contracts would undermine Kenya\\u2019s national security \\u2018since [the] terms in the contract[s] touch on foreign government information with implications on national security and foreign relations.\\u2019 Two activists\\u2014Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo\\u2014filed a petition in 2021 at the High Court in Mombasa seeking to obtain all contracts, agreements, and studies for the construction and operation of the SGR. Through a coalition called Okoa Mombasa, Khalifa had previously attempted and failed to get the documents through Kenya\\u2019s Access to Information Act after the Kenyan government directed that all containerized cargo at the Port of Mombasa be transported inland through the SGR. This move reportedly had negative impact on the Kenyan coast\\u2019s port-based economy because it forced logistics companies to move their operations to container depots in the country\\u2019s interior. \\u2018We have a right to know the details of the project: how our money is being spent, the consequences of a loan default, and the government\\u2019s decision-making processes in signing the deal. Right now, we know none of this\\u2014the Kenyan public is completely in the dark,\\u2019 said Khalifa. Gikonyo, his co-petitioner, is the national coordinator for The Institute for Social Accountability, a Nairobi-based civil society organization.    Yet another concern about the project is related to its revenue performance. It was originally projected that the railway would move 22 million tons of cargo a year. However, a Government of Kenya assessment later revealed that the maximum amount of cargo that the railway could move was approximately 8.7 million tons of cargo a year. Also, one year after the SGR was put into operation, a parliamentary report showed that it cost more than double the amount to transport goods on the train than on the road. To make the railway profitable, the Kenyan authorities compelled importers to send cargo by railway instead of by road. This decision set off protests, riots, and court cases in October 2019 and November 2019. Then, on On December 4, 2019. Kenya\\u2019s senate committee on transport summoned the Kenyan cabinet secretary for transport over his directive to haul cargo from the port city of Mombasa to Nairobi exclusively by rail. The meeting \\u2014 attended by activists, businessmen and leaders from Mombasa \\u2014 ended with the cabinet secretary, James Macharia, promising to rescind the directive, which had reportedly hurt local businesses. Then, in September 2020  Kenyan lawmakers tabled a report in parliament recommending that the government renegotiate the terms of the China Eximbank loans for the SGR \\u2018due to the prevailing economic distress occasioned by the effects of Covid 19\\u2019. In the same report, the lawmakers recommend that the government renegotiate the SGR operation agreement, \\u2018by planning to reduce operation costs by at least 50%\\u2019. The SGR operators had to halt its passenger service for nearly three months due to concerns about the potential spread of the pandemic. CRBC operates the railway\\u2019s passenger and cargo service through its subsidiary, the Africa Star Railway Operation Company. In the three years the SGR has been in operation, Africa Star Railway Operation\\u2019s expenditure has always exceeded revenue, and the Kenyan taxpayer money has to fill the gap to sustain the company\\u2019s operations. A report by Kenya\\u2019s transport ministry tabled in parliament in 2018 says the railway made a loss of KES 9.8 billion ($90.3 million) in its first year of operation. At the time, the Kenyan Government projected a profit of $46.8 million for the following year. However, a report by the transport ministry in 2020, also tabled to parliament, said the railway recorded a loss of $200 million over the previous three years. The document also said that during this period, the railway generated revenues of $230.7 million but had operational costs of $430.5 million. The transport ministry cited reduced limited storage capacity at a Nairobi container depot, minimum use of the city\\u2019s freight terminal, and railway charges as reasons for this performance, arguably the kinds of details a thorough appraisal should have raised. The SGR operates both passenger and cargo services and while passengers embrace it for reducing travel time compared to buses, cargo owners shun it for reasons including higher fees and tariffs, additional time clearing goods and a lack of last-mile delivery, when compared to trucks. Kenya\\u2019s election in August 2022 became a vote on President Uhuru Kenyatta\\u2019s legacy of debt-financed infrastructure building, much of it built and financed by China Eximbank. This was especially true for the SGR.    The opposition party candidate Raila Odinga ran on a promise to renegotiate the Kenyan government\\u2019s outstanding debts to China Eximbank. Speaking at Chatham House in London on March 16, 2022, he said he would assemble a tough team of negotiators: \\u2018It depends on how you negotiate with the Chinese. If you don't have negotiators they will of course impose their terms on you.\\u2019 Several months later, in June 2022, the ruling party presidential candidate, William Ruto, told Reuters that he would publish government contracts with Chinese companies and renegotiate loans with China Eximbank. Then, in September 2022, newly elected Kenyan President William Ruto reverted cargo clearing services from Nairobi inland container depot (ICD) to the Port of Mombasa. The expected immediate impact of reverting port operations to the Port of Mombasa was a shift to road haulage and a reduction in cargo business for the SGR. Ruto\\u2019s predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, moved cargo clearance to the Nairobi ICD to help ease congestion at the Port of Mombasa and boost its competitiveness while also boosting traffic on the SGR to increase revenue for debt repayment. The effect of Ruto\\u2019s September 2022 decision was to shift more of the responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans to Kenyan taxpayers.  In mid-October 2022, Kenya\\u2019s incoming Transport Secretary, Kipchumba Murkomen also said during his confirmation hearing that he planned to renegotiate the China Eximbank loans for the Standard Gauge Railway Project. He said that these loans were likely repayable over fifty years rather than fifteen to twenty years. He also said that \\u2018[I]f approved, I will look for the SGR agreement and make it available to the public because no one knows the contents of that agreement\\u2019. Then, in November 2022, Kipchumba Murkomen publicly disclosed all three China Eximbank loan agreements for the SGR project.  There are some indications that the SGR loans have underperformed vis-a-vis the lender's original expectations. In July 2022, the Government of Kenya received 'settlement notes' (an overdue repayment notification) from China Eximbank. Then, in October 2022, local media outlets reported (based on confidential Treasury documents) that the Government of Kenya defaulted on its China Eximbank loans for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project. The lender reportedly imposed a fine (\\u2018default interest\\u2019 payment) worth $10.8 million (1.312 billion Kenyan shillings). \",\" On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each hold a 50% ownership stake in BSGP. The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline is a 1,454 km long gas pipeline that runs through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm. The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases. The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions.   The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project commenced on July 17, 2012. The project was originally expected to be completed by the end of 2012. It was ultimately completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year. The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It was completed on December 30, 2016. Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle increased throughput.   In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BoC) on December 11, 2012 (captured via Project ID#39562). This loan bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility (loan) agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the loan\\u2019s outstanding amount was $1.462 billion USD. As of December 31, 2017, the loan\\u2019s outstanding amount was was $1.0 billion USD.   Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan agreement with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan for Phase I. CDB and BoC each contributed $350 million USD to the loan for Phase II. Project ID#73384 captures the BoC contribution. Project ID#40362 captures the CDB contribution. The $700 million loan for Phase II carried a maturity of 15 years (final maturity date: September 17, 2030). Its interest rate is unknown. Then, on August 14, 2019, Beinenu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $720 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with Bank of China and MUFG Bank, Ltd. (captured via Project #91744). The proceeds of the syndicated loan were to be used by the borrower to refinance the $1.8 billion CDB/BoC loan that it contracted on December 11, 2012. The interest rate of the August 2019 syndicated loan (3-month LIBOR plus a 1.65% margin) was lower than the interest rate of the December 2012 loan. The maturity length of the August 2019 syndicated loan (5.33 years; final maturity date: December 20, 2024) was also shorter than the maturity length of the December 2012 loan. As as result of this debt refinancing arrangement, Beinenu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP reduced its repayment obligations for Phase I by $10.5 million.\",\"On April 28, 2016, China Eximbank signed three different loan agreements with the Government of Pakistan for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi\\u2013Lahore Motorway Project. The proceeds of the BCL, GCL, and PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a $2,889,798,643 commercial contract between the Government of Pakistan\\u2019s National Highway Authority and China State Construction Engineering Corporation Limited (CSCEC), which was signed on December 25, 2015. The $361,224,830.37 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [CHINA Eximbank loan ID#1410202052016210417 and Government of Pakistan loan ID#BCL-16MWAY-CPEC] is captured in Project ID #54415. The borrowing terms are as follows: 5.2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, 5-year grace period, 0.75% ($2,709,186.23) management fee, and 0.5% commitment fee. The RMB 4.8 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2016) 7 TOTAL NO. (576) or Government of Pakistan loan ID#GCL167576-CPEC] is captured in Project ID #39013. The borrowing terms include a 2% interest rate but the maturity and grace period is unknown. The $1,790,113,000 million preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2016) 10 TOTAL NO. (390) or Government of Pakistan loan ID#PBC1610398-CPEC] is captured in Project ID #54416. The borrowing terms include a 2% interest rate but the maturity and grace period is unknown.  The Karachi\\u2013Lahore Motorway (KLM) is a 1,694 km (1,053 mile), six-lane, high-speed, limited-access motorway that connects Karachi and Peshawar through Islamabad, Lahore, Multan and Sukkur. It is considered to be a major component of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The 387 km, six-lane Sukkur-Multan section of the motorway follows the left bank of River Indus and it involved the construction of 100 bridges, 468 underpasses, 991 culverts, 11 interchanges, six pairs of service areas, five pairs of rest areas, and 24 toll stations.  A revised feasibility study was completed for this project on June 18, 2014. China State Construction and Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on August 5, 2016, and the project was completed on November 5, 2019.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank preferential buyer\\u2019s credit for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi-Lahore Highway Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the preferential buyer\\u2019s credit agreement for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi-Lahore Highway Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-036]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the preferential buyer\\u2019s credit for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi-Lahore Highway Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the preferential buyer\\u2019s credit for the Sukkur-Multan Section of the Karachi-Lahore Highway Project. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2020-December 2020 is captured via Project ID#96254. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96247. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.\",\"On June 25, 2012, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and Argentina's Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $2,099,965,834 syndicated buyer\\u2019s credit facility (loan) agreement for the Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Rehabilitation Project. CDB contributed $1,899,965.834 to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#36517) and ICBC contributed $200,000,000 to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#69134). The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4.5 year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus an 2.9% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a commitment fee of 0.125%, an an upfront (one-time) management fee of 0.20%. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer\\u2019s credit insurance policy from Sinosure worth 7.21% of the face value of the loan ($151,407,536.63).   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $2,470,548,040 commercial contract between Argentina\\u2019s Ministry of the Interior and Transport and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on March 11, 2010.   As of May 2022, the loan had achieved an 88.3% disbursement rate ($1,855,660,000 out of $2,099,965,834). The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $504,821,918.39 as of December 31, 2015, $1,230,795,697.28 as of December 31, 2017, $1,478,957,102.66 as of December 31, 2019 and $1,376,381,351.22 as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to replace 1593 km of track along the Belgrano Freight Railway, which stretches from Retiro station in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires through a total of 14 Argentine provinces: Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, C\\u00f3rdoba, San Luis, Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Tucum\\u00e1n, Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy. The rail network even connects with two neighboring countries: one of its branches links with Chile through the Socompa border crossing in Salta province, continuing to the port of Antofagasta on the Pacific. There are two alternative connections with Bolivia, neither of which are currently operating. The first is through La Quiaca in Jujuy province, the second through Salvador Mazza in Salta province. The project also involves the acquisition of 1000 wagons and 30 locomotives. This project will be implemented as part of the Argentine government\\u2019s Belgrano Plan, which is a set of transportation, infrastructure, production, health, employment, housing, and education policies and programs that target the country's northern provinces.  The rail replacement works is scheduled to take place in three phases. Work on the first phase will cover 535 km and it includes the Santurce-Tostado-Chorotis-Las Bre\\u00f1as section, the Pampa del Infierno-Los Frentones section, and the Los Pirpintos-Los Tigres-Taco Pozo sections in Santa Fe, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero provinces. Work on the second phase is 500 km in length and it includes the Coronda-Santo Tom\\u00e9 and Laguna Paiva-Nar\\u00e9 sections, both in Santa Fe province, and Talavera-Pichanal-Embarcaci\\u00f3n-Chalic\\u00e1n, between Salta and Jujuy. The third phase of the project is 558 km in length and it includes refurbishment of the Tucum\\u00e1n-Met\\u00e1n-Joaqu\\u00edn V. Gonz\\u00e1lez and Met\\u00e1n-Chalic\\u00e1n sections in Tucum\\u00e1n, Salta, and Jujuy provinces. These activities are expected to generate 23,000 jobs, including both direct and indirect employment. The project implies major logistical work, including the transportation of more than 2 million sleepers, 170,000 tons of rail, and 5 million tons of ballast stone.   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corporation (CSR) and CRRC Qishuyan \\u2014a subsidiary of the CRRC Corporation Limited \\u2014are also involved in the project as subcontractors.   An official project commencement ceremony took place on July 18, 2014. However, construction activities did not begin until December 2014. The project was originally expected to reach completion within two years (December 2016). CMEC had delivered 107 locomotives and 2500 carriages by February 2017.  Then, in January 2018, locomotives manufactured by China's CRRC Qishuyan, arrived in Argentina. On May 31, 2019, President Macri attended the inauguration ceremony of the first 700 km of renewed railway tracks of the Belgrano Cargas train in the town of Joaquin V. Gonzalez in Salta province. As of May 2022, the project had achieved a 77.96% completion rate.   The Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Rehabilitation Project was at risk of cancellation and loan default in 2016. On July 18, 2014, Argentina\\u2019s Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $4,714,350,000 syndicated term loan facility agreement with three Chinese state-owned banks (Bank of China, China Development Bank, and ICBC) for the construction of two hydroelectric dams (the so-called Kirchner-Cepernic dams) on the Santa Cruz River in Patagonia. The loan agreement included a cross-default clause, stating that if the borrower canceled the project, CDB financing for a separate project (the $2,099,965,834 loan for the Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Project) would also be cancelled. In November 2015, newly elected Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced his intention to suspend the construction of the Kirchner-Cepernic dams. These dams are located on the Santa Cruz River near the famous Perito Moreno Glacier (UNESCO World Heritage Site) that feeds from the same river, and the Macri administration considered these dams to be too risky on environmental grounds. When President Macri first announced his intention to suspend the project, CDB, ICBC, and Bank of China had already disbursed $950 million under the syndicated term loan agreement.   Then, on March 10, 2016, CDB sent a warning letter to Argentina's Finance Minister, Alfonso Prat Gay, The letter said: \\\"The Kirchner-Cepernic dams and the Belgrano Cargas are major projects promoted by the Chinese Communist Party and signed during the same political time period in Argentina and each one of the ... facility agreements contain cross-default clauses.\\\" The Macri administration subsequently reversed course and announced that it no longer intended to suspend construction of the Nestor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Dams.  On January 19, 2022, an MOU was signed between the Ministry of Transport, the Administraci\\u00f3n de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias Sociedad del Estado, and China Railway International Group Co., Ltd. regarding cooperation in railway matters. This was signed so as to carry out the Modernization and Electrification Project of the Belgrano Norte Railway.\",\"On June 3, 2010, China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Ecuador signed a $1,682,745,000 buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) agreement [Contract No. 1410202052010210644] for the 1500 MW Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an annual interest rate of 6.9%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 1.5%, a grace period of 5.5 years, a maturity of 15 years, a 0.4% commitment fee, and a 0.4% management fee. The loan agreement required that the borrower purchase buyer\\u2019s credit insurance from Sinosure.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of the $1,979,700,000 EPC contract between Coca Codo Sinclair E.P. and Sinohydro Corporation, which was signed on October 5, 2009.   As of December 2016, the loan (BCL) had achieved an 87.7% disbursement rate ($1,476,205,953.32 out of $1,682,745,000). The borrower made principal repayments worth $93,485,833.33 on March 21, 2017, $93,485,833.33 on September 21, 2017, $93,485,833.33 on March 21, 2018, $93,485,833.33 on September 21, 2018, $93,485,833.33 on March 21, 2019, $93,485,833.33 on September 21, 2019, $93,485,833.33 on March 21, 2020, and $128,543,020.84 on March 21, 2022. It did not make any principal repayments on the originally scheduled repayment dates of September 21, 2020, March 21, 2021, September 21, 2021, and September 21, 2022. The loan\\u2019s (principal) amount outstanding was $1,589,259,166.67 as of March 20, 2017, $1,495,773,333.34 as of September 20, 2017, $1,402,287,500.01 as of March 21, 2018, $1,308,801,666.68 as of September 21, 2018, $1,2015,315,833.35 as of March 21, 2019, $1,121,830,000.02 as of September 21, 2019, $1,028,344,166.69 as of March 21, 2020, $1,028,344,166.69 as of September 21, 2020, $1,028,344,166.69 as of March 21, 2021, $1,028,344,166.69 as of September 21, 2021, $1,028,344,166.69 as of December 31, 2021, $899,801,145,85 as of March 21, 2022, $899,801,145,85 as of September 21, 2022, and $$899,801,145.86 as of November 30, 2022.   The Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric project was first proposed in the early 1980s but could not be implemented because of the Reventador volcanic eruption in 1987 and financial constraints. Then, in 2007, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa restarted the project and Italian company Electroconsult was contracted to conduct a new feasibility study. In February 2008, Coca Codo Sinclair SA was established as a joint venture company between Ecuador\\u2019s state-owned power company Termopichincha (70% ownership stake) and Energia Argentina (30% ownership stake). The Government of Ecuador then bought the entire 30% ownership stake of Energia Argentina for $5.5 million in September 2009. Coca Codo Sinclair E.P. \\u2014 a project company (special purpose vehicle) \\u2014 was eventually established to oversee the design and implementation of the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project. Its sole shareholder is La Corporaci\\u00f3n El\\u00e9ctrica del Ecuador E.P. (CELEC), an Ecuadorian state-owned holding company engaged in electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 1500 MW hydroelectric power plant in El Reventador on the Coca River between the provinces of Napo and Sucumb\\u00edos. The plant\\u2019s eight turbines were designed to produce 8.8 billion kWh per annum, supplying 35% of the country\\u2019s overall electricity consumption and saving about two billion liters of imported diesel for thermal power plants per year. The project was developed in an area where the Coca River flows in a great curve at a natural slope of 620 meters. The water intake complex is located on the Coca River, 1 km downstream of the confluence of the Quijos and Salado rivers. It comprises a concrete face rockfill dam built on the existing river channel, a concrete spillway built on the left bank of the river, and the sedimentation basin and intake built between the dam and spillway. Any water diverted from the intake passes via the 120 meter-long sedimentation basin to run through a 24.8 km-long concrete-lined headrace tunnel, with an excavation diameter of 9.1 meters, into the compensating reservoir, which has a usable volume 800,000m\\u00b3. Water from the compensating reservoir is fed through two 1,900 meter-long penstocks to the eight Pelton turbines installed in the underground powerhouse, which measure 26m x 50m x 192m. A parallel cavern of 16.5m x 33m x 192m houses 24 single-phase transformers of 68.3 MVA each and a 500kV substation. The access path to the powerhouse is 495m long, 6.5m wide and 7.5m high. A tailrace tunnel delivers water back to the Coca River. The hydroelectric project is designed to use a 620 meter-high natural waterfall with a maximum regulated flow of water of 278m\\u00b3/s. Coca Codo\\u2019s run-of-river intake has a maximum capacity of 7,500m\\u00b3/s. The sedimentation basin has six bays and a design sediment particles size of 0.25mm, while the maximum derived flow in the headrace tunnel is 222m\\u00b3/s. Two penstocks with vertical shaft and horizontal reach feed the water from the compensating reservoir to the eight generating units of the plant. In addition, the power plant is equipped with eight six-nozzle vertical Pelton turbines, each with a rated output of 187.7MW. Each turbine is powered by a runner with 22 buckets with a width of 835mm.   Sinohydro was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and its work was overseen by Coca Codo Sinclair E.P. and CELEC. Project implementation commenced on July 28, 2010. The access road to the powerhouse was completed in October 2012. A tunnel collapse at the plant construction site killed 13 people and injured 12 in December 2014. It also caused partial damage to the high-pressure pipes inside the engine room. The project was ultimately completed on November 18, 2016. Its originally scheduled completion date was January 28, 2016.   Since then, the project has been plagued by a variety of engineering problems and corruption accusations.  In 2017, the Ecuadorian tax authority (SRI) uncovered pending taxes of $198 million from Sinohydro. One of the main controversies involved a payment of $172.5 million by Sinhohydro to China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) for the purchase of an insurance policy, for which Sinohydro sought tax deductions, which SRI rejected. Then, in December 2018, the New York Times reported that \\u20187,648 cracks have developed in the dam\\u2019s machinery, according to the government, because of substandard steel and inadequate welding by Sinohydro. Sand and silt are also big concerns because they can damage vital equipment.\\u2019  In May 2021, CELEC requested arbitration through the International Chamber of Commerce to settle a dispute over cracks in the power plant\\u2019s machinery that prevented it from operating at full capacity since it was completed in 2016 (after $2.2 billion in construction costs). Then, in July 2021, Reuters reported that new problems at the hydroelectric plant threatened water flow and electricity generation. During a shutdown of four of the facility\\u2019s eight turbines for planned maintenance, CELEC discovered missing bolts on some of its valves. CELEC CEO Gonzalo Uquillas said that the problem could prevent valves from opening and closing to adequately regulate the flow of water. \\u2018Of the 96 bolts that secure the seals on these valves, some bolts are missing,\\u2019 Uquillas said in an interview on July 16, 2021. He added that \\u2018I don\\u2019t want to believe they weren\\u2019t installed, but they are missing.\\u2019 Then, in March 2023, Ecuador's Prosecutor General filed charges against 37 people, including the former President of Ecuador Len\\u00edn Moreno (2017-2021) and five former employees of Sinohydro (Cai Runguo, Yan Huijun, Song Dongsheng, Wu Yu, and Liu Aisheg) for allegedly accepting bribes worth $1.1 million to secure the commercial contract for the 1500MW Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Facility Project.  The China Eximbank loan (BCL) that supported the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project has also financially underperformed. It was rescheduled twice \\u2014 once in September 2020 (as captured via Project ID#93431) and again in September 2022 (as captured via Project ID#96292).\",\"On May 9, 2014, China Development Bank (CDB) entered into a $2.5 billion master facility agreement with the Government of Angola.   The agreement is a master agreement under which the Government of Angola and CDB may conclude individual loan agreements (ILAs) for the purpose of financing up to 85% of the contract price owing to certain approved contractors in respect of certain approved infrastructure projects in Angola, primarily in the areas of housing, transportation, agriculture, roads and railways, hospitals, schools, telecommunication, water and electricity, sanitation and other human livelihood areas agreed by CDB and Angola. Each individual (subsidiary) loan approved through the facility must be for a minimum of $10 million and have a maturity of 10 years.   As of December 31, 2017, $2,199,500,000 was drawn down under the MLFA. The (principal) amount outstanding under the MLFA was $300.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The availability period for drawdowns under this master facility agreement ended on May 9, 2017. However, it was later extended until 2021.   Projects that may have been funded through the master facility agreement include: 1. Construction of access roads to Luanda International Airport (Project ID#65307) 2. Rehabilitation of New Luanda International Airport (Project ID#72349)  There are indications that the May 2014 CDB loan financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015. The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2\\u20132023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024\\u201325. The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account \\u2014 known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) \\u2014 to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023.\",\"On January 14, 2014, China Eximbank approved a \\u2018mixed credit\\u2019 worth approximately $6.5 billion for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. China Eximbank agreed to cover 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. This 'mixed credit' arrangement produced four different financial commitments: two preferential buyer's credits (PBC), one government concessional loan (GCL), and one buyer's credit loan (BCL). On January 14, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $382,848,800 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 50 TOTAL NO. (294)]. Its borrowing terms are unknown (captured via Project ID#92413). On February 19, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed an RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 5 TOTAL NO. (509)] carrying a 1% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and an 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41916). On December 15, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $3,618,151,200 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) and Government of Pakistan loan ID# PBC-2015-18-360] for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41918). This agreement was amended on October 8, 2019 [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) (A)], but the purpose of the amendment is unknown. Additionally, on December 18, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $2.25 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401 and BCL 2015212932] carrying a 6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41917).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent some or all of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) -- a federally funded independent governmental agency -- at a 15% interest rate. The Government of Pakistan also reportedly issued sovereign guarantees for all four China Eximbank loans that supported the project. In December 2015, the amounts outstanding under all four China Eximbank loans (worth $5.668 billion) were reportedly transferred by the Government of Pakistan to PAEC (as the direct borrower).   The purpose of the project was to construct units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), which is located in Paradise Point in Karachi within Sindh Province.  China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It is using Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 26, 2013. Then, a major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called \\u2018cold functional tests\\u2019 began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. K-2 was ultimately connected to the national grid on March 18, 2021. It was officially inaugurated on May 21, 2021 and put into operation on May 24, 2021. The K-3 reactor came online on March 4, 2022. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020.  There are some indications that the $2.250 billion China Eximbank buyer's credit loan for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2019, PAEC sought the Prime Minister's approval to have the interest rates of the China Eximbank loans for Units 2 and 3 of the KANUPP Project reset to their original levels (when they were first issued by China Eximbank). Local sources reported at the time that the electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was set on the basis of actual electricity generation costs and on-lending at a 15% rate increased actual electricity generation costs by PKR 108 billion (necessitating an PKR 1.8/kWh increase in the tariff rate). However, it is unclear if the Prime Minister approved PAEC\\u2019s request. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the $2.250 billion buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-031]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the $2.250 billion buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the  $2.250 billion buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, in April 2022, local media reported that the operation of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant and the repayment of the China Eximbank loans that supported its construction had become a challenge due the absence of requisite payments from the Government of Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency\\u2013Guaranteed (CPPA-G). The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2020-December 2020 is captured via Project ID#96254. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96249. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.\",\"On July 24, 2018, China Development Bank (CDB) and Eskom \\u2014 South Africa's state-owned energy utility company \\u2014 signed a $2.5 billion loan (term facility) agreement for the 4800MW Kusile Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 3.7149% interest rate. The borrower is expected to make 20, equal semiannual installments (on March 12 and September 12 of each year) over a 10 year period (after the expiration of the grace period). The South African Government issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. However, the interest rate and other key terms and conditions in the loan agreement remain unavailable, as President Ramaphosa indicated that this information will not be made public due to confidentiality clauses. The successful conclusion of the $2.5 billion CDB loan agreement brought Eskom in line with the company\\u2019s commitment to secure 62% of its financial year 2018/19 funding requirement. By the end of 2021, the loan\\u2019s estimated disbursement rate was 83.62%.   The purpose of the project is to construct the Kusile coal-fired power station (plant), which contains six units with about 800MW capacity each, totaling about 4800MW in the La Faral area of Limpopo, South Africa. The project also includes a power station precinct, power station buildings, administrative buildings, roads, and a high-voltage yard. The total cost of the project is $19.1 billion.   Construction of the Kusile Station commenced on June 5, 2007. However, by April 2011, the project had only achieved a 21% completion rate. In 2015, it was reported that Unit 1 would come online in 2016 and the last unit would come online by 2021. However, the project was still being implemented as of 2022. The expected completion year of the Kusile Power Station is now 2026 (after being pushed back from its originally scheduled completion date of 2023).   Project delays have resulted from the financial management problems of Eskom and the termination of a turbines contract with Alstom. According to IJGlobal, in the 11 years since the project was announced, it has attracted no fewer than 22 banks, export credit agencies, and investment funds all of which offered different services, such as Bank of America (advisory service); Deutsche Bank (loan); JP Morgan (funding plan adviser); Barclays (advisory service); Credit Suisse Group (transaction adviser); Societe Generale (loan); and China Development Bank (loan). The loan from the China Development Bank came at an opportune time as many banks and insurers in Europe, the US, and Japan have in the past few years announced changes to their energy investment policies to exclude financing for new coal-fired power projects.  There are some indications that the $2.5 billion CDB loan for the 4800MW Kusile Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In February 2019, the CEO of Eskom was asked the following question by a reporter: 'Can you indicate and comment in general terms on the World Bank, DBSA, China Development Bank and other DFI loan covenants, and what may be considered a breach, such as failure to meet required going concern status, debt service coverage ratio and/or other metrics?' He responded that 'I am cautious not to breach the confidentiality of the lenders, but generally speaking, the going-concern status of Eskom is informed by normal credit metrics \\u2014 interest cover, debt service cover, and so on. When we do find ourselves in a situation where we will not meet these requirements, many of the terms do allow us to put forward an action plan on how it\\u2019s going to be resolved.' Then, in February 2023, South Africa\\u2019s National Treasury announced that it would would take on ZAR 254 billion ($14 billion) of Eskom's ZAR 423 billion debt that was at risk of default, to enable the state-owned power utility to pay down its principal and interest obligations.\",\"The Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail (HSR) Project was originally going to be financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). In January 2014, JICA included the project in its Overseas Development Aid plan for Indonesia and agreed in principle to bankroll 75% of the total cost of the project at a 0.1% interest rate so long as the host government provided a loan repayment guarantee. However, Beijing was determined to win the contract for the HSR project and sought to outcompete Tokyo on several dimensions, including cost, speed of implementation, and level of public liability. In early 2015, Indonesian President Joko Jokowi invited China to submit an alternative proposal, and it proposed a lower cost version of the project that could be fully-financed with a government-guaranteed (CDB) loan at a 2% interest rate and implemented on a shorter timeline (3 years rather than 5 years).   Then, in September 2015, when President Jokowi was expected to announce the winning bidder, he surprised everyone by rejecting Beijing\\u2019s offer and Tokyo\\u2019s offer and \\u201ccancelling\\u201d the project. The stated rationale for his decision was that the project would lead to a ballooning of public debt. Tokyo responded by offering a 50% reduction in the amount of debt that would need to be backed by a sovereign guarantee. Beijing responded by scrapping the sovereign guarantee requirement altogether and proposing an off-public balance sheet transaction, in which CDB would work around the country\\u2019s public debt ceiling by extending a loan to a special purpose vehicle (jointly owned by Chinese and Indonesian state-owned companies) rather than the Government of Indonesia. Beijing\\u2019s revised offer was sufficiently attractive to seal the deal.   On October 16, 2015, a consortium of Indonesian state-owned companies (called PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN) and a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies (called Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd) established a joint venture and special purpose vehicle called PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (also known as PT Kereta Api Indonesia China or KCIC) to design, finance, implement, and manage the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project. PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN (PSBI) \\u2014 a joint venture of PT Wijaya Karya Tbk (38% ownership stake), PT Kereta Api Indonesia (25% ownership stake), PT Perkebunan Nusantara VIII (25% ownership stake), and PT Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk. (12%) ownership stake \\u2014 holds a 60% ownership stake (shareholding interest) in KCIC. Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd \\u2014 a joint venture of China Railway International Co. Ltd., China Railway Group Limited, Sinohydro Corporation Limited, CRRC Corporation Limited, and China Railway Signal and Communication Corp. \\u2014 holds the remaining 40% ownership stake (shareholding interest) in KCIC. Then, on May 14, 2017, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $3.9675 billion loan agreement with KCIC for the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail Project.   The loan consists of two tranches: a USD-denominated tranche worth $2.3805 billion (captured via Project ID#61320) and an RMB-denominated tranche worth $1.587 billion (captured via Project ID#61321). The USD-denominated tranche carries the following borrowing terms: 40-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and no sovereign guarantee. The RMB-denominated tranche carries the following borrowing terms: 40-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 3.46% interest rate, and no sovereign guarantee. ICBC is the security agent for the loan. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an EPC contract between KCIC and seven Indonesian and Chinese state-owned firms, which was signed on April 4, 2017. The total cost of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project is $5.29 billion and it is being financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. The equity contribution of Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd. is captured via Project ID#61322.   The purpose of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project is to construct a 142.3 km high-speed railway from the city of Jakarta to Bandung, the capital of West Java. Upon completion, the railway is expected to reduce the travel time between Jakarta and Bandung from more than 3 hours to less than 40 minutes. Construction began on January 21, 2016. However, the first CDB loan disbursement ($170 million) did not occur until May 2018. CDB planned to disburse another $1.1 billion before the end of July 2018. In May 2019, the 608-meter Walini tunnel was built. By September 2019, 32.8% of the project\\u2019s construction activities were complete and land acquisition progress reached 99%. By mid-February 2020, construction progress had reached 44% and land acquisition progress reached 99.96%. Then, in March 2020, the 442-meter No.5 tunnel was finished. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, work on the project was temporarily halted during the spring of 2020. Construction resumed in June 2020, and as of September 2020, the Director of KCIC Xin Xuezhong reported that construction progress had reached 60% and land acquisition progress had reached 100%.   The Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project, which was originally scheduled for completion in May 2019, has encountered a number of different problems during implementation. First, Indonesia Law No. 32/2009 regarding Environment Management and Control requires an environmental impact assessment (EIA) be developed over at least one year (and include analysis for both dry and rainy seasons) for a project of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR\\u2019s scale. However, the EIA for the project was completed in less than 6 months, and environmental NGOs claim that it contains inaccurate and flawed data analysis regarding the project\\u2019s actual environmental impacts. Second, the project reportedly violated Government Regulation No. 27/2012 regarding environmental permits, which requires public participation in the making of the EIA document. Environmental NGOs claim that, due to a lack of public participation in the EIA process, the project has serious design defects, including a planned route through numerous geological faults, which has led to delays, cost overruns, and local opposition. Third, although KCIC exclusively appointed PT Pilar Sinergi, a state-owned enterprise to deal with land acquisition issues, the process has not proceeded as smoothly as the Indonesian government had hoped. In July 2018, three lawsuits resulted in legal approval from the courts to proceed with claims seeking compensation for their properties affected by the project. Fourth, Indonesia\\u2019s Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR) ordered a temporary halt to the project on March 2, 2020 after flooding blocked the main toll road between Jakarta and the city of Cikampe. Acting Director General of Public Works Danis Sumadilaga said piles of soil dumped on roadsides had buried drainage channels and caused the flooding, adding that shoddy management practices paid scant attention to health, safety, and environmental degradation concerns. Fifth, during the construction process, gas pipelines owned by the national Pertamina Oil Company were damaged, which caused an explosion and killed a Chinese worker in Melong, near Cimahi town. Sixth, blasting work for tunnels in the area of the Tipar Sari Asih housing complex in the West Java town of Cimahi has caused serious damage. According to Meiki Paendong, executive director of WALHI West Java, an environmental NGO based in Bandung, \\u201c[m]any walls of [nearby] houses cracked \\u2026 [and] there was information that [the company] would examine the impact, but until now, the results of the inspection have not been made public.\\u201d Seventh, when flooding hit the Jakarta suburb of Bekasi in January 2020, Deputy Mayor Tri Ardhianto Tjahyono pointed to the HSR project as a cause, as did officials in the West Bandung regency which also flooded. Arief Maulana, head of Bekasi City Public Works and Water Management, said that \\u201c[o]ne of KCIC effects\\u2026 is the problem of drainage control in several project activity locations, which are close to the drainage area that causes sedimentation and also disrupted waterways.\\u201d Maulana argued that it is the responsibility of KCIC to fix all drainage damage due to the project. KCIC eventually agreed to repair and restore the drainage system after the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry demanded an assessment of the project in March 2020, due to environmental degradation concerns. Meiki Paendong, executive director of WALHI West Java, argues that the flooding in Bekasi and elsewhere demonstrated that the project\\u2019s EIA was flawed, as it failed to address the closure and loss of drainage flows due to land-use change. For example, drainage canals were covered by landfills, which reportedly increased flooding throughout the rainy season.   In 2015, Indonesian President Joko Jokowi signed a decree prohibiting the use of government funds for the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project. However, during implementation, the project encountered major cost overruns worth an estimated $2 billion due to various factors, including but not limited to higher-than-expected land procurement costs, delays in construction due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the rising prices of materials, and additional project insurance costs and debt service reserve account (DSRA) requirements. Then, in October 2021, President Jokowi reversed course, issuing a new decree and authorizing a government bailout of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project. The Indonesian government reportedly authorized the use of $286.7 million from state coffers to inject liquidity into PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (the borrowing institution) in the next fiscal year. It also made clear that it was prepared to provide additional funding on an as needed basis. At the time, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), said that \\u2018like it or not, \\u2026 we have to ask the government to participate in funding the project if we want it to be finished on time.\\u2019 Then, in July 2022, the project\\u2019s prime contractor (PT KCIC) reported that the project had achieved an 85% completion rate. At that time, Jakarta-Bandung HSR saw the laying of ballasted tracks begin on its main line. One month later, in August 2022, high-speed bullet trains for the Indonesian Jakarta-Bandung HSR rolled off the assembly line in Qingdao within China\\u2019s Shandong Province. Eleven pairs of high-speed electric multiple units (EMUs) and one set of comprehensive testing bullet railcars were ready to be shipped to Indonesia.   As of August 2022, all Jakarta-Bandung HSR tunnels had been completed and more than 90 percent of the subgrade, bridge and station civil works had been completed. By October 2022, the project had achieved a 88.8% completion rate. Also, during the last quarter of calendar year 2022, Indonesian state auditor BPKP reported that the cost overruns associated with the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project were just under $1.5 billion (rather than the earlier estimate of $2 billion). On October 18, 2022, Indonesia\\u2019s Deputy Minister of SOEs Kartiko Wirjoatmodjo announced that \\u2018[w]e are currently in the final negotiation with CDB for additional loans for cost overruns'. He also indicated that KCIC would contract one or more supplementary loans worth $1.03 billion (IDR 16.1 trillion) from CDB to cover approximately 75% of the project\\u2019s cost overruns (worth $1.45 billion). Then, on November 9, 2022, KCIC Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi told a legislative committee that the project\\u2019s cash flow would run out by the end of the month and China\\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) agreed that 75% of the project\\u2019s cost overruns should be funded with the proceeds of an additional CDB loan. At the time, KCIC was also asking parliament to make another IDR 3.22 million cash injection into the project company (as an additional equity contribution on behalf of PSBI) in conjunction with an additional IDR 2.15 trillion equity contribution from Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd. KCIC Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi told the legislative committee that completing the project by June 2023 would require receipt of additional project debt and equity by the end of November 2022.   On March 31, 2023, the track laying of the whole line of the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway was completed. Then, on April 10, 2023, Indonesia' Chief Investment Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said that KCIC had been working with CDB to lower the interest rate attached to the supplementary loan to cover the project's cost overruns. The Indonesian Government proposed a $560 million loan at a 2%interest rate from China Development Bank (CDB) to pay for the cost overruns. In April 2023, Luhut told a press briefing in Jakarta that '[CDB] is already willing to bring the interest down from 4 percent. The first offer is a reduction from 4 percent to 3.4 percent, but we want it to be even lower. [...] We do want a 2 percent interest, but it is impossible to have everything [we want] come true. If you ask for loans [outside China], the interest can go up to 6 percent. So if we end up with a 3.4-percent rate, we are doing okay, although not that okay. But that would be better than [borrowing money from other countries].' Luhut also noted that a 3.4 percent interest rate would not necessarily be problematic: 'Do not underestimate our country. We are getting better. Our state tax revenue has grown by 48.6 percent [in January 2023] thanks to better efficiency with digitalization, etc.'  As of April 2023, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway was expected to launch its commercial operations on August 18, 2023 \\u2014 one day after the 78th anniversary of Indonesia's independence day.  Then, in May 2023, Indonesia\\u2019s Transport Ministry and three consulting firms -- Mott MacDonald, PwC and local law firm Umbra -- pushed back on the suggestion that the project could achieve full-fledged commercial operations by August 18, 2023. At the time, the Chinese participants in KCIC reportedly wanted a full operational worthiness certificate for the Jakarta-Bandung HSC despite the incomplete construction of a railway station, but the Indonesian Transport Ministry and its consultants suggested that KCIC might not achieve full-fledged commercial operations until December 31, 2023.   Then, in June 2023, Reuters reported that KCIC was still in negotiations with CDB over a $560 million supplemental loan (captured via captured via Project ID#96344). After CDB offered an interest rate of 3.46% on the loan's RMB-denominated tranche, KCIC reportedly countered with a 2.8% interest rate request.\",\"In June 2009, China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to provide a $3 billion line of credit to JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna (also known as \\u2018Samruk-Kazyna\\u2019). Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as \\u2018Kazakhmys Corporation LLC\\u2019 and \\u2018Kazakhmys\\u2019) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility.  Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC \\u2014 and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower \\u2018principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.\\u2019 As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025. Project ID#61056 captures the $1,844,000,000 loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and Project ID#40241 captures the rescheduling of that loan. Project ID#96105 captures the $148,500,000 loan for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project and Project ID#96106 captures the rescheduling of that loan. Project ID#95747 captures the $200 million loan for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project, while Project ID#95748 captures the $200 million loan for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Project ID#95749 captures the $200 million loan for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. Project ID#95750 captures the $300 million borrowing by Samruk-Kazyna for an unspecified purpose. The Bozshakol mine is a large copper mine located in the North Kazakhstan Region. The scope of the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project included the construction of 22 km of highway and 18 km of access roads connected to the mining production site, the construction of 26 km of railroad, the installation of 130 km of pipelines and 500 km of cabling, the installation of fully automated Production Control Systems, the construction of a 5.5 km long Tailing Dam and related structures, the construction of various permanent buildings (measuring 39.000 m\\u00b2), and the construction of concrete, steel-prefabricated buildings.  The project sought to establish facilities able to mine 30 million tons per year. A $560 million EPC contract for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was signed between KAZ Minerals PLC and Alarko Contracting Group on September 20, 2011. China Nonferrous Metal Industry\\u2019s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was also involved in the project\\u2019s complementation. Mobilization work started in March 2012 and construction of the temporary site building and facilities were completed in the same year. Approximately 42.000 m\\u00b3 of concrete production and 5.000 tons of steel construction were completed by May 2013. The panel coating works of the process buildings started in May 2013. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on March 15, 2015.  The completion of construction activities and the commencement of commissioning works was ultimately held on September 29, 2016. The Bozymchak mine is an open-pit copper and gold mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region, Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan (exact locational coordinates: 41.2586, 71.0647). It is estimated to contain combined indicated and inferred resources of 16.5 million tons with 0.95% copper and 1.58 g/t gold. The scope of the project involved the development of the mine and its ancillary facilities. NFC was responsible for implementation. The project\\u2019s pre-feasibility study was completed in July 2008. It was originally expected to reach completion by December 2014. However, the mine was not initially commissioned until March 2014. The mine was fully commissioned and reached its commercial operations date (COD) on or around August 5, 2015. The Bozymchak mine restarted operations on December 26, 2020 after a temporary suspension that began on October 7, 2020, following political instability in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Abyz copper mine and the Nurkazgan copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 50.16861, 73.00333). Stripping works at Abyz mine commenced in January 2014. At that time, it was expected that the mine would recommence production in Q3 of 2014. The Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Akbastau-Kosmurun copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 48.60611,77.78861 and 48.6437, 77.7102). The project commenced on January 30, 2009. Its completion date is unknown. The Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Zhomart copper mine, which exploits the 14 km long Zhaman-Aybat orefield deposits that are located approximately 160 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The first stage of the mine\\u2019s development was commissioned in 2006 with a planned capacity of around 4 million tons of ore a year. The second phase of the project was schedule for implementation from 2012 to 2017 with a production start in 2018. The de facto completion date of the $300 million loan that Samruk-Kazyna contracted for an unspecified purpose was January 2013 (when it was fully repaid).\",\"On May 31, 2010, Baha Mar Ltd. \\u2014 a project company and special purpose vehicle \\u2014 entered into a $2.45 billion secured loan facility agreement with China Eximbank for the Baha Mar Resort Construction Project. The $3.5 billion Baha Mar Resort and Casino Project consisted of, among other things (a) a $2.45 billion secured debt facility provided by the Export-Import Bank of China; (b) a $150 million preferred equity commitment provided by a subsidiary of CSCEC, China State Construction Engineering Corporation (Bahamas) Ltd. (\\u201cCSCEC (Bahamas)\\u201d); and (c) an $850 million common equity investment by the Developer (a prominent resident of the Island, Sarkis Izmirlian). The common equity investment of the Developer consisted of cash, land for the Project along Cable Beach and the three hotels then-operating thereon, as well as other commitments. The China Eximbank facility agreement carries the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.9% margin, a 15 year maturity, and no grace period. The loan\\u2019s final maturity date is January 31, 2026 (the fifteenth anniversary of the first utilization (disbursement) date, which was January 31, 2011). Penalty interest on any overdue amounts is payable at a rate of 1 percent above LIBOR plus a 3.9% margin.   The debtor and creditor negotiated 4 security and pledge agreements, including without limitation: (a) Debenture between Baha Mar Ltd and certain of the other Debtors, as Chargors, and Citibank, N.A., Bahamas Branch (the \\u201cOnshore Security Agent\\u201d), dated as of January 31, 2011, in which Chargors pledged bank accounts, real property, plant and machinery and intellectual property rights; (b) Security Agreement between Northshore Mainland Services Inc., as Security Provider, and the Offshore Security Agent, dated as of January 31, 2011, in which the Pledgor pledged all personal property, including but not limited to all bank accounts; (c) Owner Packages Account Pledge, between CCA Bahamas Ltd., as Security Provider, and the Offshore Security Agent, dated as of January 26, 2011 in which CCA Bahamas Ltd. pledge certain accounts; (d) Deposit Accounts Pledge Agreement between Baha Mar Ltd., Baha Mar Properties Ltd., BMP Three Ltd., Cable Beach Resorts Ltd., and Baha Mar Enterprises Ltd., as Security Providers, and the Offshore Security Agent, dated as of January 31, 2001, in which the Security Providers pledged certain accounts.   As of June 29, 2015, the loan's total (principal) amount outstanding was $2,337,876,519.   The purpose of the project was to construct the Baha Mar Resort, a 1,000-acre (400 hectare) resort complex on the island of New Providence in The Bahamas. Once completed and fully operational, the project was expected to include the following four new hotels with 2,323 guest rooms (inclusive of 284 condos and villas), a casino, and a convention center:   (a) Baha Mar Casino & Hotel: A 100,000 square foot Las Vegas-style casino and premiere hotel with 1,068 rooms and suites, designed to appeal to international casino clientele, and boasting dedicated VIP entrances, suite levels, and VIP/premium gaming areas. The Baha Mar Resort is located in Nassau in the Bahamas. Once the project was completed, the Baha Mar Casino & Hotel was to be operated by GGAM Bahamas Holdings, LLC.   (b) The Grand Hyatt Hotel\\u00ae and Convention Center at Baha Mar: A premiere hotel with 733 rooms and suites designed to cater to business guests utilizing the connected convention center, which boasts 84,000 square feet of standalone, flexible facility space capable of accommodating large-scale performances, events and conferences, including three ballrooms of 33,000, 18,000, and 15,000 square feet, and 18,000 square feet of additional meeting and board rooms allowing the convention center to accommodate a variety of events concurrently. Once the project was completed, the Grand Hyatt Hotel\\u00ae and Convention Center at Baha Mar was to be operated by Hyatt Services Caribbean LLC. In addition, the hotel has certain for-sale residential condominium units, a number of which are under contract.   (c) The Rosewood\\u00ae at Baha Mar: A \\u201cluxury\\u201d hotel with 232 rooms and suites designed to appeal to upscale guests, featuring its own ballroom, meeting facilities, private spa and salon. Once the Project is completed, Rosewood\\u00ae at Baha Mar will be operated by Rosewood Hotels & Resorts LLC. In addition, the hotel has certain for-sale residential condominium and villa units, a number of which are under contract.   (d) The SLS Lux\\u00ae at Baha Mar: A \\u201clifestyle\\u201d hotel with 299 rooms and suites designed to appeal to younger guests who prefer a more modern and trendy hotel. Once the project was completed, the SLS Lux\\u00ae at Baha Mar was to be operated by SBE Hotel Management LLC. In addition, the hotel has certain for-sale residential condominium and villa units, a number of which are under contract.   China Construction America (CCA) -- a subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) -- was appointed as the main contractor for the project. The project sponsor (BML Properties) and CSEC jointly developed the project. CSCEC took a minority ownership stake in the project. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 21, 2011. Then, on November 11, 2011, traffic on West Bay Street was diverted to flow freely around the perimeter of the project site. On June 9, 2014, fifty CCA workers protested outside the Chinese Embassy in Nassau, claiming that they had not been paid in six months. Then, on August 1, 2014, Baha Mar Ltd announced that the grand opening of the resort would not take place in December 2014 (as originally scheduled). On October 1, 2014, Bahamian contractors disclosed that it was 'a grind' to obtain timely payment from CCA for work done on the Baha Mar project, with wait times of 90-120 days affecting their cash flow and eating into already-thin profit margins. Then, on March 24, 2015, Baha Mar Ltd issued a statement saying the resort\\u2019s opening will have to be pushed back, claiming inferior quality work by CCA. By June 2015, the project had achieved a 97% completion rate. However, on June 30, 2015, Baha Mar Ltd announced that it has commenced a claim in the English High Court in London against CCA\\u2019s parent company, CSCEC, seeking $192 million worth of damages for late payments and poor workmanship. Then, after temporarily suspending work, CCA returned to Baha Mar site to assess the work needed to complete the project in September 2015. At the time, 120 local Bahamian contractors were demanding payments worth $74.3 million for work already done before resuming work on the resort. The Baha Mar resort officially opened on April 14, 2017. However, the resort did not begin taking paying guests until June 1, 2018. The project's originally scheduled construction commencement date was September 19, 2011 and its originally scheduled construction completion date was December 8, 2014. The resort was originally expected to open on March 27, 2015  The China Eximbank loan that was issued for the project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On June 29, 2015, with the Baha Mar resort 97% complete, Baha Mar Ltd., the developer of the resort, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. The underlying cause of the filing was a commercial dispute between Baha Mar Ltd. and its construction company. In November 2015, the Bahamas Supreme Court named Deloitte & Touche LLP as a receiver to Baha Mar Ltd. at the request of the Export-Import Bank of China, which is a primary creditor having made a $2.45 billion loan to Baha Mar Ltd. in 2010. In March 2016, the receiver engaged Colliers International, an international real estate firm, to actively market the resort to a new owner. A U.S. judge eventually dismissed the Chapter 11 case brought by Baha Mar's Bahamian companies. On August 23, 2016 the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Perry Christie, announced that the Government of the Bahamas and the Export-Import Bank of China had signed an agreement to complete construction of the Baha Mar mega-resort. Construction at the resort had been stalled for 20 months. The Export-Import Bank of China created a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Perfect Luck Holdings to purchase Baha Mar\\u2019s real estate assets out of receivership, which was the first step towards completing the project\\u2019s physical construction prior to its sale to the \\u2018ultimate buyer\\u2019. At the same time, the original Baha Mar companies were placed into full liquidation under the supervision of the Supreme Court and the former provisional liquidators. These two developments threatened to cost Sarkis Izmirlian and his family their total $800-$900 million equity investment in building up the Baha Mar project over the past 13 years. Then, on August 22, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bahamas signed a 'Heads of Terms Agreement' to facilitate the remobilization, completion of construction, and the opening, operation and eventual sale of the Baha Mar Resort -- a part of which involved setting up a fund to pay the majority of the Bahamian unsecured creditors (including the utility providers) in return for which the Government of the Bahamas granted valuable tax and others concessions. The 'Heads of Terms Agreement' provided for the following: (i) a commitment by the China Eximbank to the immediate resumption and completion of construction of the resort, and the opening of the Casino, Casino Hotel, Convention Centre and Golf Course; (ii) a commitment from China Eximbank to fund the remaining construction costs; (iii) the establishment of a voluntary fund of $101.5 million to pay the majority of unsecured creditors, including Bahamian government utility corporations; (iv) the establishment of a Claims Committee to oversee the payment process for unsecured creditors; and (iv) the establishment of deadlines for the commencement of construction, and the completion of various steps needed to accomplish the completion, opening and sale of the Resort. Effective November 30, 2016, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Limited (CTFEL) and CTF BM entered into a share purchase agreement with The Export-Import Bank of China and Perfect Luck Investments Limited for the sale and purchase of the Baha Mar Project. \",\"On January 14, 2014, China Eximbank approved a \\u2018mixed credit\\u2019 worth approximately $6.5 billion for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. China Eximbank agreed to cover 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. This 'mixed credit' arrangement produced four different financial commitments: two preferential buyer's credits (PBC), one government concessional loan (GCL), and one buyer's credit loan (BCL). On January 14, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $382,848,800 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 50 TOTAL NO. (294)]. Its borrowing terms are unknown (captured via Project ID#92413). On February 19, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed an RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 5 TOTAL NO. (509)] carrying a 1% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and an 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41916). On December 15, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $3,618,151,200 preferential buyer\\u2019s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) and Government of Pakistan loan ID# PBC-2015-18-360] for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41918). This agreement was amended on October 8, 2019 [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) (A)], but the purpose of the amendment is unknown. Additionally, on December 18, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $2.25 billion buyer\\u2019s credit loan (BCL) [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401 and BCL 2015212932] carrying a 6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41917).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent some or all of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) -- a federally funded independent governmental agency -- at a 15% interest rate. The Government of Pakistan also reportedly issued sovereign guarantees for all four China Eximbank loans that supported the project. In December 2015, the amounts outstanding under all four China Eximbank loans (worth $5.668 billion) were reportedly transferred by the Government of Pakistan to PAEC (as the direct borrower).   The purpose of the project was to construct units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), which is located in Paradise Point in Karachi within Sindh Province.  China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It is using Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 26, 2013. Then, a major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called \\u2018cold functional tests\\u2019 began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. K-2 was ultimately connected to the national grid on March 18, 2021. It was officially inaugurated on May 21, 2021 and put into operation on May 24, 2021. The K-3 reactor came online on March 4, 2022. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020.  There are some indications that the $3.618 billion China Eximbank preferential buyer's credit for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2019, PAEC sought the Prime Minister's approval to have the interest rates of the China Eximbank loans for Units 2 and 3 of the KANUPP Project reset to their original levels (when they were first issued by China Eximbank). Local sources reported at the time that the electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was set on the basis of actual electricity generation costs and on-lending at a 15% rate increased actual electricity generation costs by PKR 108 billion (necessitating an PKR 1.8/kWh increase in the tariff rate). However, it is unclear if the Prime Minister approved PAEC\\u2019s request. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the $3.618 billion preferential buyer's credit agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-031]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the $3.618 billion preferential buyer's credit agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the  $3.618 billion preferential buyer's credit agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, in April 2022, local media reported that the operation of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant and the repayment of the China Eximbank loans that supported its construction had become a challenge due the absence of requisite payments from the Government of Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency\\u2013Guaranteed (CPPA-G). The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2020-December 2020 is captured via Project ID#96254. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from January 2021-June 2021 is captured via Project ID#96257. The debt service suspension (rescheduling) from July 2021-December 2021 is captured via Project ID#96253.\",\"On April 11, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and China Eximbank signed a syndicated facility (loan) agreement with OAO Yamal LNG (or JSC Yamal LNG or \\u041e\\u0410\\u041e \\\"\\u042f\\u043c\\u0430\\u043b \\u0421\\u041f\\u0413\\\") \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Russia\\u2019s OAO NOVATEK (50.1% ownership stake), France's Total S.A. (20% ownership stake), and China's CNPC (20% ownership stake) and Silk Road Fund (9.9% ownership stake) \\u2014 for the Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The facility agreement was amended on April 29, 2016. The financing from CDB and China Eximbank is part of the project finance package totaling the equivalent of $18.4 billion.  The total cost of the project is approximately $36 billion and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. The project reached financial close with CDB and China Eximbank in June 2016.   CDB issued both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67064) was worth EUR 5,057,800,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67063) was worth RMB 5,286,000,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%.   China Eximbank provided both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67062) was worth EUR 4,279,700,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. It also carried a maturity of 15.166 years (final maturity date: June 15, 2031), a grace period of 3.66 years, (first repayment date December 15, 2019), a 2% management fee, a 1.5% commitment fee, and a default (penalty) interest rate was 1.5%.

In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069).   The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant \\u2014 with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field \\u2014 located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek \\u2014 Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer \\u2014 to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia\\u2019s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called \\u201cNational Wealth Fund\\u201d). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019\\u20132021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (\\u5927\\u9023\\u4e2d\\u9060\\u6d77\\u904b\\u6cb9\\u54c1\\u904b\\u8f38\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: \\u00ab\\u042d\\u0434\\u0443\\u0430\\u0440\\u0434 \\u0422\\u043e\\u043b\\u043b\\u044c\\u00bb), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0420\\u0443\\u0434\\u043e\\u043b\\u044c\\u0444 \\u0421\\u0430\\u043c\\u043e\\u0439\\u043b\\u043e\\u0432\\u0438\\u0447\\u00bb), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: \\u00ab\\u041d\\u0438\\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u0430\\u0439 \\u0415\\u0432\\u0433\\u0435\\u043d\\u043e\\u0432\\u00bb), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0412\\u043b\\u0430\\u0434\\u0438\\u043c\\u0438\\u0440 \\u0412\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u043d\\u0438\\u043d\\u00bb) all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0413\\u0435\\u043e\\u0440\\u0433\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0423\\u0448\\u0430\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432\\u00bb) which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: \\u00ab\\u042f\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432 \\u0413\\u0430\\u043a\\u043a\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u00bb) which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (\\u682a\\u5f0f\\u4f1a\\u793e\\u5546\\u8239\\u4e09\\u4e95). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsv\\u00e5g, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from \\u2018unfriendly states\\u2019\\u2014including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine\\u2014in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia\\u2019s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia\\u2019s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany\\u2019s Euler Hermes, Sweden\\u2019s EKN, Austria\\u2019s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China\\u2019s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia\\u2019s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'\",\"On April 11, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and China Eximbank signed a syndicated facility (loan) agreement with OAO Yamal LNG (or JSC Yamal LNG or \\u041e\\u0410\\u041e \\\"\\u042f\\u043c\\u0430\\u043b \\u0421\\u041f\\u0413\\\") \\u2014 a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Russia\\u2019s OAO NOVATEK (50.1% ownership stake), France's Total S.A.

The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek \\u2014 Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer \\u2014 to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia\\u2019s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called \\u201cNational Wealth Fund\\u201d). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019\\u20132021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (\\u5927\\u9023\\u4e2d\\u9060\\u6d77\\u904b\\u6cb9\\u54c1\\u904b\\u8f38\\u6709\\u9650\\u516c\\u53f8) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: \\u00ab\\u042d\\u0434\\u0443\\u0430\\u0440\\u0434 \\u0422\\u043e\\u043b\\u043b\\u044c\\u00bb), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0420\\u0443\\u0434\\u043e\\u043b\\u044c\\u0444 \\u0421\\u0430\\u043c\\u043e\\u0439\\u043b\\u043e\\u0432\\u0438\\u0447\\u00bb), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: \\u00ab\\u041d\\u0438\\u043a\\u043e\\u043b\\u0430\\u0439 \\u0415\\u0432\\u0433\\u0435\\u043d\\u043e\\u0432\\u00bb), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0412\\u043b\\u0430\\u0434\\u0438\\u043c\\u0438\\u0440 \\u0412\\u043e\\u0440\\u043e\\u043d\\u0438\\u043d\\u00bb) all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: \\u00ab\\u0413\\u0435\\u043e\\u0440\\u0433\\u0438\\u0439 \\u0423\\u0448\\u0430\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432\\u00bb) which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: \\u00ab\\u042f\\u043a\\u043e\\u0432 \\u0413\\u0430\\u043a\\u043a\\u0435\\u043b\\u044c\\u00bb) which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (\\u682a\\u5f0f\\u4f1a\\u793e\\u5546\\u8239\\u4e09\\u4e95). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsv\\u00e5g, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury\\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from \\u2018unfriendly states\\u2019\\u2014including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine\\u2014in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia\\u2019s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia\\u2019s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia\\u2019s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany\\u2019s Euler Hermes, Sweden\\u2019s EKN, Austria\\u2019s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China\\u2019s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia\\u2019s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'\"],\"shape\":[206],\"dtype\":\"object\",\"order\":\"little\"}],[\"Status\",{\"type\":\"ndarray\",\"array\":[\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Implementation\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Implementation\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Implementation\",\"Implementation\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Implementation\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Implementation\",\"Completion\",\"Implementation\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Implementation\",\"Implementation\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Completion\",\"Pipeline:
